# 沒 Psalm 91 (KJV)
*A declaration of divine protection, strength, and deliverance*

---

**1.** He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High  
窶ピhall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

**2.** I will say of the Lord,  
窶ォe is my refuge and my fortress:  
窶ノy God; in him will I trust.

**3.** Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,  
窶ヂnd from the noisome pestilence.

**4.** He shall cover thee with his feathers,  
窶ヂnd under his wings shalt thou trust:  
窶ドis truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

**5.** Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;  
窶ハor for the arrow that flieth by day;

**6.** Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness;  
窶ハor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

**7.** A thousand shall fall at thy side,  
窶ヂnd ten thousand at thy right hand;  
窶ッut it shall not come nigh thee.

**8.** Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold  
窶ヂnd see the reward of the wicked.

**9.** Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge,  
窶テven the most High, thy habitation;

**10.** There shall no evil befall thee,  
窶ハeither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

**11.** For he shall give his angels charge over thee,  
窶フo keep thee in all thy ways.

**12.** They shall bear thee up in their hands,  
窶ネest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

**13.** Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:  
窶フhe young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

**14.** Because he hath set his love upon me,  
窶フherefore will I deliver him:  
窶オ will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

**15.** He shall call upon me, and I will answer him:  
窶オ will be with him in trouble;  
窶オ will deliver him, and honour him.

**16.** With long life will I satisfy him,  
窶ヂnd shew him my salvation.
