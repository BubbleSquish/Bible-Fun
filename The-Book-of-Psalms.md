Below, each relevant Psalm is detailed with the exact King James verse, a plain interpretation, context, and cross-references:

## Psalm 1 – The Perishing Way of the Wicked

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 1:5–6* — “Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the **LORD** knoweth the way of the righteous: **but the way of the ungodly shall perish**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God warns that the wicked will have no place among the godly when judgment comes. They may walk their own path now, but it leads only to ruin and death – like chaff blown away and burned.
* **Context:** Psalm 1 contrasts the fates of two groups. The righteous person delights in God’s law and prospers, whereas the ungodly reject God. This opening warning makes clear that, in the final judgment, unrepentant sinners will not survive or share the assembly of the saved. Their entire lifestyle (“way”) ends in destruction by God’s decree.
* **Cross References:** *Proverbs 14:12* teaches a similar truth: a way that seems right to a man ends in death. Jesus also describes two paths – the broad way “that leadeth to destruction” and the narrow way of life (Matthew 7:13–14).

## Psalm 2 – Messiah’s Wrath Against Rebels

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 2:11–12* — “Serve the **LORD** with fear, and rejoice with trembling. **Kiss the Son**, lest he be angry, and ye **perish from the way**, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God’s anointed Son (the Messiah) issues a warning to proud human rulers: humble yourselves and submit to Him (“kiss the Son” as an act of homage), or else face His fierce anger. Even a little of the Son’s wrath will cause rebels to perish suddenly from their path. Conversely, those who take refuge in Him will find blessing.
* **Context:** In this royal psalm, earthly kings plot against the **LORD** and His Messiah. God responds by installing His Son as King over all. The verses above are the ultimatum given to the nations: they must serve the Lord with reverence and trembling joy. **Jesus Christ**, the ultimate fulfillment of this “Son,” will break the rebellious with a rod of iron. The imagery of perishing “from the way” means their course of life and plans will be destroyed by Messiah’s judgment if they do not surrender.
* **Cross References:** This psalm finds echoes in the New Testament: *Revelation 2:27* quotes verse 9 (the Messiah “shall rule them with a rod of iron”) as Jesus’ authority. Also, *Revelation 19:15* describes Christ at His return striking the nations and treading the winepress of God’s wrath. Ultimately “every knee” will bow to Jesus (Philippians 2:10–11); those who refuse will be broken and removed (Luke 19:27).

## Psalm 5 – God Hates Evil and Destroys Liars

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 5:5–6* — “The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: **thou hatest all workers of iniquity**. **Thou shalt destroy them** that speak leasing (lies): the **LORD** will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The Lord is utterly holy and has no tolerance for evil. He *hates* everyone who practices sin and iniquity. Those who speak lies or commit bloodshed are abhorrent to Him, and God Himself will *destroy* them. In simple terms: evildoers cannot survive in God’s presence; His judgment will wipe them out.
* **Context:** David, in this morning prayer, contrasts God’s love for righteousness with His opposition to wickedness. Unlike false gods of the nations, the true **LORD** has a moral character – He is not indifferent to evil. Verse 5 declares that unrepentant sinners (“workers of iniquity”) are loathsome to God. Verse 6 foretells their fate: God will **ruin** liars and murderers. This is not a capricious anger, but the just response of a righteous Judge who cannot let evil dwell with Him. David later prays in verse 10 for God to make the wicked fall by their own schemes, reinforcing that their destruction is deserved and certain.
* **Cross References:** *Habakkuk 1:13* affirms that God is too pure to look approvingly on evil. Likewise, *Proverbs 6:16–19* lists lying tongues and hands that shed innocent blood among the things the **LORD** *hates*. In the New Testament, believers are warned that “because of these things (sins) cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience” (Ephesians 5:5–6, KJV).

## Psalm 7 – God’s Sword Against the Unrepentant

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 7:11–13* — “God judgeth the righteous, and **God is angry with the wicked every day**. *If he turn not*, **he will whet his sword**; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God is a righteous Judge who feels indignation toward the wicked continually. If a sinner **does not repent (“if he turn not”)**, God is depicted as sharpening His sword and bending His war bow in preparation – in other words, God is poised to unleash deadly judgment on the unrepentant. The Lord has deadly weapons already aimed at those who persecute and harm others.
* **Context:** David sang this concerning a slanderous enemy, appealing to God’s justice. He acknowledges God’s constant anger at wickedness (not a momentary tantrum, but a steady, holy wrath). The vivid imagery – a sharpened sword, a drawn bow with arrows of death – serves as a warning: God’s patience has limits. If the evildoer does not “turn” from his evil, divine judgment will strike suddenly and lethally. In the following verses (14–16), David notes how the wicked often fall into the pits they dig, but here in verses 12–13, it is God Himself who actively prepares lethal judgment for them. This emphasizes the certainty and severity of punishment for unrepentant sinners.
* **Cross References:** The “whetting” (sharpening) of God’s sword recalls *Deuteronomy 32:41*, where God says, “If I whet my glittering sword… I will render vengeance to mine enemies.” The ongoing posture of wrath parallels *Nahum 1:2*, “the **LORD** reserveth wrath for his enemies.” In the New Testament, *John 3:36* warns that God’s wrath *abides* on whoever rejects the Son – a continuous anger like Psalm 7 describes. Also, *Hebrews 10:31* notes, “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”

## Psalm 9 – The Wicked Nations Turned into Hell

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 9:17* — “**The wicked shall be turned into hell**, and all the nations that forget God.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God solemnly warns that the wicked will be sent to **hell** (the realm of the dead and punishment). This fate isn’t just for individuals but for “all nations” that ignore and forget God. In plain terms: every society or person who lives in defiance of God can expect to be cast into the horrors of judgment after death.
* **Context:** This psalm celebrates God’s victory over enemies and His just rule. Earlier verses recount God rebuking and destroying the wicked, even blotting out their name forever. Verse 17 is a climactic pronouncement: it pictures the wicked being dragged to **Sheol** (Hebrew for the grave or hell) as a direct result of their godlessness. “Forget God” doesn’t imply mere absent-mindedness, but willful neglect and unbelief. Such nations experience defeat and death as God’s judgment, ultimately ending up in hell. This verse served as a stark reminder to Israel that powerful empires (like those that fell in judgment) forgot God and perished. It’s both a warning and a comfort: a warning to the wicked and an assurance to the oppressed that evil will not triumph in the end.
* **Cross References:** *Psalm 50:22* issues a similar warning to those who forget God – God will “tear \[them] in pieces” with none to deliver. In the New Testament, Jesus urges us to *“fear him who… hath power to cast into hell”* (Luke 12:5). Also, *Matthew 25:32, 41* portray nations and people who disregarded God’s ways being sent into everlasting fire at the final judgment.

## Psalm 10 – “Break the Arm of the Wicked” (Prayer for Justice)

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 10:15* — “**Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man**: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist calls on God to shatter the strength of the wicked. “Break the arm” means to break their power and ability to do evil. He’s essentially praying: *Lord, crush the wicked person’s power, and don’t stop until no evil is left unpunished.* He asks God to hunt down every last vestige of the evildoer’s wickedness and judge it completely.
* **Context:** Psalm 10 describes arrogant oppressors who prey on the helpless and think God doesn’t see them. By verse 15, the writer transitions from describing the wicked to directly petitioning God. “Arm” symbolizes strength; a broken arm can no longer strike. So the prayer is that God would incapacitate these evil men. “Seek out his wickedness till thou find none” implies a thorough judgment – God is asked to investigate and expose all their crimes, leaving no evil deed unaccounted for. Immediately after this, verse 16 proclaims that God is King forever and the nations perish from His land. Thus, verse 15 is pivotal: it hands the problem of unchecked evil over to the divine Judge to resolve.
* **Cross References:** The imagery of breaking the arm of the wicked is echoed in *Ezekiel 30:21–22*, where God says He has broken Pharaoh’s arm (power). Also, *Psalm 37:17* assures that “the arms of the wicked shall be broken” while the Lord upholds the righteous. This is exactly what the psalmist prays for in Psalm 10. God “seeking out” all wickedness until none remains parallels His promise to bring *every* work into judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14).

## Psalm 11 – Fire and Brimstone Upon the Wicked

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 11:5–6* — “The **LORD** trieth the righteous: **but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth**. **Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest**: this shall be the portion of their cup.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God examines (tests) the righteous with care, but He **hates** those who persist in wickedness and love violence. For such wicked people, the promised fate is terrifying: God will rain down traps and **burning sulfur fire** on them – a furious storm of judgment. That is their “portion,” the cup of wrath they must drink. In simple terms, violent evildoers are loathsome to God, and He will punish them by raining hellish fire upon them.
* **Context:** David, likely under threat from enemies, affirms his trust in God’s justice. Verse 5 boldly states that God’s soul (His very self) hates the wicked who love violence. This is the flip side of God’s love for the upright. In verse 6, David alludes to the famous judgment on **Sodom and Gomorrah** – those cities received burning sulfur (brimstone) from heaven (Genesis 19:24). Here he says a similar fiery tempest will be the wicked man’s “portion” (i.e. allotted share from God’s hand, like a cup given to drink). The inclusion of “snares” (traps) indicates they cannot escape this firestorm; it will entangle and consume them. “Portion of their cup” is imagery for one’s destined experience – in this case, God’s wrath served as a bitter drink. This psalm assures the faithful that, though the wicked seem to target them now, God’s own hatred and hot judgment against the wicked is certain.
* **Cross References:** God’s fiery judgment on the wicked is seen in *Genesis 19:24–25* (fire and brimstone on Sodom). Later biblical writers recall this as a warning (Luke 17:28–29, Jude 1:7). *Isaiah 66:15–16* likewise speaks of the Lord coming with fire and whirlwind to render anger with fury. And *Revelation 21:8* declares that the portion for the unrepentant wicked (“the fearful, unbelieving… murderers… liars”) will be the lake that burns with fire and brimstone – an ultimate fulfillment of the imagery David uses.

## Psalm 12 – The Lord Will Cut Off Flattering Lips

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 12:3* — “The **LORD** shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God promises to silence and destroy those who use their speech for evil – specifically, people who flatter with ulterior motives and speak with arrogant pride. “Cut off” means He will **eliminate** these deceitful talkers, removing their influence and even their lives. In plain language: every smooth-talking liar and boaster will be dealt with by God’s judgment, their arrogant voices abruptly ended.
* **Context:** This psalm laments a society where godliness has dwindled and treacherous speech abounds. Verses 2–4 describe people speaking vanity and flattery, with double hearts and a defiant attitude (“our lips are our own: who is lord over us?”). In response, verse 3 is God’s declaration of intent: He *will* “cut off” such lips and tongues. This could imply death or at least the cessation of their lies (to “cut off” often means to destroy or exterminate in Scripture). It is stated as a certainty, not just a wish. Thus, however dominant liars and boasters seem, God has set Himself against them. He will not allow lying, oppressive speech to go on forever unchecked. In contrast, verse 7 says God will preserve the godly. Verse 5 also shows God arising to defend the poor from those very oppressors. So the context makes it clear: this cutting off is an act of deliverance and justice from the Lord.
* **Cross References:** *Proverbs 19:9* parallels this warning: “a false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.” Jesus similarly warned that *“every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment”* (Matthew 12:36) – God will judge boastful, careless speech. *Psalm 31:18* is another plea: “Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly...” – essentially asking God to do what Psalm 12:3 promises.

## Psalm 17 – “Cast Down the Wicked, O Lord”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 17:13* — “Arise, O **LORD**, disappoint him, **cast him down**: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:”
* **Plain Interpretation:** David prays for God to take action against a violent enemy. In modern terms he says: “Lord, stand up and face my enemy. Make him stumble and **knock him to the ground**. Rescue me from this wicked man – I see him as an instrument in Your hand.” The phrase “which is thy sword” suggests that this wicked oppressor is being used by God as a sword of testing or judgment, but David asks God now to sheath that sword by overthrowing the enemy.
* **Context:** Psalm 17 is a plea for vindication against cruel foes. David asserts his own innocence and calls on God to show His “marvellous lovingkindness” (v.7) by saving him. In verse 13, “Arise, O **LORD**” is a common cry for God to intervene. “Disappoint him” can be understood as “confront him” or “forestall his plans.” “Cast him down” is emphatic – David wants the enemy thrown down to the earth, no longer a threat. Interestingly, calling the wicked “thy sword” reflects a deep insight: sometimes God allows the wicked to chastise or test the righteous (as tools in His sovereign hand). David acknowledges that, but still petitions for deliverance now that the refining purpose is done. He contrasts these “men of the world, who have their portion in this life” (v.14) with his hope in seeing God’s face (v.15). Thus, the immediate request is for God to break the power of the wicked persecutor.
* **Cross References:** David often prayed similarly. In *Psalm 7:6*, “Arise, O **LORD**, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies.” God casting down the wicked is also affirmed in *Psalm 147:6*: “The **LORD** lifteth up the meek: He casteth the wicked down to the ground.” In the New Testament, Paul echoes that God sometimes uses the wicked for His ends yet will judge them – e.g., *2 Thessalonians 1:6* says it is righteous for God to “recompense tribulation to them that trouble you.” David’s view of the wicked as God’s sword resonates with *Isaiah 10:5–12*, where God wields Assyria as a rod to punish Israel, but then promises to cast down Assyria for its pride.

## Psalm 21 – Fiery Wrath on the King’s Enemies

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 21:9* — “Thou shalt make them as a **fiery oven** in the time of thine anger: the **LORD** shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** Addressing God’s anointed King (ultimately the Messiah), this declares that when His anger flares up, He will turn His enemies into something like a blazing furnace. The Lord’s wrath will completely consume them – **devouring them with fire**. In other words, the King’s foes will be burned up by God’s fiery judgment, utterly destroyed by His hot anger.
* **Context:** This royal psalm celebrates the victories of God’s chosen king (immediately David, and prophetically Christ). Early verses thank God for giving the king life, victory, and honor. But verses 8–12 shift to speak of the king’s **future** conquests over enemies. Verse 8 says, “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies… those that hate thee”. Then verse 9 (quoted above) graphically describes their fate: being made like a fiery oven. The imagery suggests *either* they will be **in** a fiery oven (burning up), or themselves become fuel for fire. “Swallow them up” is reminiscent of how fire consumes completely. This “time of thine anger” implies a set day of wrath. In a messianic sense, it looks forward to Christ’s day of judgment upon the nations. Not only the individuals, but verse 10 adds their offspring (“fruit/seed”) will be wiped out – a total eradication of the wicked lineage. It’s a militant, triumphant tone: no enemy of God’s King will escape this blazing fury.
* **Cross References:** The imagery of fire devouring God’s enemies connects to *Malachi 4:1*, “the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: that day shall burn them up.” Also *2 Thessalonians 1:7–8* speaks of the Lord Jesus being revealed “in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God.” *Revelation 19:15* similarly describes Christ striking the nations and treading the winepress of God’s wrath – the outcome being the flesh of His enemies consumed (Revelation 19:17–21). Psalm 21’s prophecy thus aligns with the final judgment of the Messiah’s foes in Scripture.

## Psalm 28 – “Give Them According to Their Deeds”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 28:4–5* — “**Give them according to their deeds**, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; **render to them their desert**. Because they regard not the works of the **LORD**, nor the operation of his hands, **he shall destroy them**, and not build them up.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** David asks God to pay the wicked back in full for their evil actions. In modern terms: “Lord, treat them exactly as they treated others. They deserve every bit of punishment for their malicious work – give them what they’ve earned.” The reason is given: they have ignored God’s works and authority. Therefore, God will tear them down completely, refusing to ever rebuild what remains of them. They will be **demolished** with no restoration.
* **Context:** David begins Psalm 28 pleading for God’s help and distinguishing himself from the wicked (v.3). Verses 4–5 (above) then turn into an imprecatory prayer against those wicked oppressors – likely corrupt leaders or false friends (“neighbors” who speak peace but hide mischief, v.3). The language “render to them their desert” means “give them what they deserve.” This is a cry for strict justice: *measure for measure*. Importantly, verse 5 shifts from David’s plea to a prophetic statement of what **God** will do: because the wicked have no regard for God’s handiwork or His providence, God **Himself** will destroy them completely. “Not build them up” implies there will be no recovery or second chance; their downfall is final. This echoes the covenant principle that those who spurn God will be uprooted from the land (Deuteronomy 28:--). David’s prayer aligns his desire with God’s will – asking God to carry out the justice He has already ordained for such hardened wickedness.
* **Cross References:** The idea of repaying the wicked according to their deeds is common in Scripture. *Jeremiah 17:10* (and Romans 2:6) says God gives each man according to his ways, *“according to the fruit of his doings.”* In the New Testament, *Galatians 6:7* warns, “Be not deceived… whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” For the finality of destruction, *Job 18:5–7, 17* notes the wicked man’s lamp is put out and his remembrance perishes from the earth – a “not built up” end. And *Proverbs 1:24–31* describes those who ignored God’s counsel reaping disaster with no answer from God – very much like Psalm 28:5, they “regard not the works of the **LORD**.”

## Psalm 31 – Let the Wicked Be Ashamed and Silent in the Grave

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 31:17–18* — “Let me not be ashamed, O **LORD**; for I have called upon thee: **let the wicked be ashamed**, and let them be **silent in the grave**. **Let the lying lips be put to silence**; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** David prays that he himself would not be put to shame for trusting God. In stark contrast, he asks that the wicked be the ones disgraced, reduced to silence in death (“the grave”). In other words: *May my enemies – those boastful liars – be the ones who end up ashamed and speechless in Sheol.* He specifically asks God to shut the mouths of those who proudly spew lies and insults against the godly. Their proud, slanderous talk should end in the silence of the tomb.
* **Context:** David is distressed by enemies and seeking refuge in God (v.1–4). Throughout the psalm he contrasts his fate with that of the wicked. By verses 17–18, he makes a bold, perhaps imprecatory request. Ancient honor-shame culture considered it a great disgrace to be proven wrong or defeated. David says, “Lord, don’t let me be disgraced for relying on You; instead, let *the wicked* be publicly shamed.” To “be silent in the grave” graphically suggests dying and going to Sheol where they can no longer strut or talk. Verse 18 elaborates that these wicked are characterized by “lying lips” that speak arrogantly against the righteous – essentially blaspheming and taunting the people of God. David asks that God *muzzle* and eliminate such voices. This came true in various instances (e.g. the fate of Doeg the Edomite who lied about priests, or Absalom’s end – both silenced ultimately). Theologically, it affirms that God vindicates His servants and the wicked who refuse to repent will end in death and infamy, not in triumph.
* **Cross References:** This plea is echoed in other psalms: *Psalm 94:17* speaks of silence in death if God hadn’t helped, and *Psalm 94:23* says God brings back on the wicked their iniquity and will “cut them off.” In terms of silencing liars, *Psalm 63:11* similarly declares, “the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.” In the New Testament, *Jude 1:15* talks of the Lord coming to convict *“all the ungodly… of all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”* Ultimately, at the final judgment, **“every mouth** \[will] be stopped” (Romans 3:19) – the boastful will have nothing to answer when God judges.

## Psalm 34 – God Turns His Face Against Evildoers

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 34:16* — “**The face of the LORD is against them that do evil**, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God is not neutral toward evil people – *He actively opposes them*. When it says “the face of the **LORD** is against” evildoers, it means God has set Himself to thwart and condemn them. His goal is to “cut off” even their memory from the earth, i.e. to wipe them out so completely that no one remembers them. In simple terms: those who persist in doing evil will find God Himself as their enemy, working to erase their legacy.
* **Context:** Psalm 34 is David’s song of thanksgiving after God delivered him (when he pretended madness before Abimelech). It’s an acrostic poem about the blessings of trusting God. In verses 11–14 David instructs others to fear the Lord and do good. Then verses 15–16 present a sharp contrast: *“The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous”* (for deliverance), *“but* the face of the LORD is *against* them that do evil.” This is a promise of divine justice. Being “cut off from the earth” implies death and the end of posterity or reputation. It may mean their family line and name will be ended by God as punishment. The next verses (17–18) return to how God hears the righteous, and verse 21 reinforces, *“Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.”* Thus, verse 16 is part of a broader teaching: although the wicked may seem to flourish temporarily, God is firmly set against them and their end is oblivion. It encourages the godly that God notices moral distinctions and will act accordingly.
* **Cross References:** The apostle Peter quotes this very verse in *1 Peter 3:12*: “the face of the Lord is against them that do evil,” to encourage Christians that God will deal with persecutors in time. *Proverbs 10:7* says “the name of the wicked shall rot,” aligning with the idea of their remembrance being cut off. *Job 18:17* similarly predicts the memory of the wicked will perish from the earth. In contrast, *Proverbs 2:21–22* promises the upright will remain in the land, but “the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.” God’s face *against* someone is terrifying – e.g. *Leviticus 26:17* warned Israel if they did evil, God’s face would be against them and they’d be slain by enemies. Thus, no one who does evil should presume to escape God’s notice or opposition.

## Psalm 35 – “Let Destruction Come Upon Them Unawares”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 35:5–6* — “**Let them be as chaff before the wind**: and let the angel of the **LORD** chase them. **Let their way be dark and slippery**: and let the angel of the **LORD** persecute them.” *(See also verse 8: “Let destruction come upon him at unawares… and let his net that he hath hid catch himself.”)*
* **Plain Interpretation:** David calls on God to make his enemies like **chaff** – the lightweight husks separated from grain – blown away by the wind with no resistance. He prays that God’s angelic agent will pursue and terrify them. He asks that their path be **dark and slippery**, meaning they should be thrown into confusion, unable to find footing, and overtaken by disaster. In short: *may my attackers be scattered, panicked, and wiped out before they even know what hit them.* He even adds (in v.8) that ruin should strike them unexpectedly and that they fall into their own trap.
* **Context:** Psalm 35 is an intense plea for vindication against unjust enemies (possibly Saul’s men or other false accusers). David repeatedly asserts he showed them kindness, but they rewarded him with evil (v.12–14). The quoted verses are part of David’s imprecations (curses) in response. “Chaff before the wind” is classic imagery for worthless people easily driven to destruction (as in Psalm 1:4). The mention of “the angel of the **LORD**” reflects belief in divine agents executing judgment (compare 2 Samuel 24:15–17, where an angel brings plague). David asks that divine forces hunt his foes down a dark, slippery ravine – a poetic picture of total rout and horror. In verse 8 (not fully quoted above), he prays their hidden net trap will ensnare themselves – poetic justice. These prayers might sound harsh, but David emphasizes he acted righteously and was repaid with treachery (v.7 says they dug a pit for him without cause). Thus, he is entrusting vengeance to God (rather than taking it himself) and vividly expressing how complete and sudden he desires God’s judgment on them to be.
* **Cross References:** Similar imagery of enemies blown like chaff appears in *Psalm 1:4* and *Psalm 83:13*. *Isaiah 17:13* also says God will rebuke nations and they’ll flee like chaff on mountains before wind. The prayer for a “dark and slippery” path echoes *Jeremiah 23:12*, where God declares a false prophet’s way “shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein.” The concept of enemies falling into their own pit is found throughout Scripture: *Psalm 7:15* (“he made a pit… and is fallen into the ditch which he made”) and *Proverbs 26:27* (“Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein”). By praying this, David aligns with a biblical principle that God often turns the schemes of the wicked back on their own heads.

## Psalm 36 – The Evildoers Cast Down, Unable to Rise

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 36:12* — “There are the workers of iniquity fallen: **they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist concludes with a picture of the wicked already toppled. It’s as if he points and says: “Look! Those who do evil have fallen flat. They’ve been thrown down and **can’t get up** again.” In simple terms, God will bring down the workers of sin so decisively that they won’t ever recover or resume their evil.
* **Context:** Psalm 36 contrasts the wicked man’s sinfulness (v.1–4) with God’s precious mercy and righteousness (v.5–9). David then prays for continued favor to the upright (v.10) and protection from the proud and wicked (v.11). The last verse (v.12) is stated in a tone of accomplished fact – possibly as a prophetic assurance or a vision of God’s judgment. It’s like David sees the end state: the evildoers overthrown. “There” might refer either to a specific place of defeat (perhaps in God’s house or general domain of the righteous) or simply, “behold, thus it ends for them.” Being “cast down” echoes language of final judgment (the idea of being thrown down permanently). They cannot rise, meaning their downfall is permanent and irreparable. This could be immediate (like seeing an enemy army defeated) or ultimate (the final fate of all unrepentant sinners). In context, after extolling God’s steadfast love, David is confident that **evil will not prevail**. The psalm that began describing transgression deep in the wicked’s heart (v.1) ends by describing the wicked flat on the ground, unable to continue.
* **Cross References:** *Psalm 18:38* has David saying of his enemies, “I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.” Though spoken of a battle, it parallels God’s action against the wicked generally. *Job 40:12* (God speaking to Job about pride) says to abase the proud and “tread down the wicked in their place.” In the New Testament, Jesus uses similar finality in *Luke 20:18*: those on whom the cornerstone (Christ) falls will be “ground to powder.” While Psalm 36:12 itself isn’t directly quoted elsewhere, its sentiment is echoed in promises like *Malachi 4:3*: the wicked “shall be ashes under the soles of your feet” – utterly cast down. It’s a comfort that no matter how arrogantly “the workers of iniquity” strut now (v.11 alludes to their foot trying to trip the righteous), their end is to lie fallen and powerless.

## Psalm 37 – The Inevitable Doom of the Wicked

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 37:20* — “But **the wicked shall perish**, and the enemies of the **LORD** shall be as the fat of lambs: **they shall consume**; into smoke shall they consume away.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** Although the wicked may flourish temporarily, God guarantees they will **perish**. David uses a vivid sacrificial image: in an animal sacrifice, the fatty parts are burned into smoke on the altar. Likewise, God’s enemies will burn or vanish like fat in a fire – *going up in smoke*. In short: the wicked will be destroyed and disappear, evaporating into nothingness under God’s judgment.
* **Context:** Psalm 37 is a wisdom psalm contrasting the short-lived success of evildoers with the lasting inheritance of the righteous. Repeatedly, David counsels not to fret over the wicked, because their doom is certain: “they shall soon be cut down like the grass” (v.2), “his day is coming” (v.13), “the arms of the wicked shall be broken” (v.17), etc. Verse 20 (quoted) uses a metaphor from Israelite worship. “Fat of lambs” produces a thick smoke when burned – indicating total consumption. By saying the wicked will be *like that fat*, David implies they will be utterly consumed by God’s fire of judgment until only smoke (a memory) remains. “Consume away” is repeated for emphasis – a double affirmation that they will vanish. The rest of the psalm elaborates: the wicked’s offspring will be cut off (v.28), they may seem formidable like a “green bay tree” but then suddenly are gone (v.35–36). Verse 38 sums up, “transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off.” So verse 20 fits in as one of many assurances that the prosperity of the wicked is fleeting and their annihilation is decreed.
* **Cross References:** *Psalm 73:18–19* echoes this by saying God sets the wicked in slippery places and casts them down to destruction in a moment, utterly consuming them with terrors. *Malachi 4:1* also resonates: the wicked will be like stubble in an oven – leaving neither root nor branch. In terms of “smoke,” *Psalm 68:2* earlier said, “As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish”. In the New Testament, *Hebrews 10:27* warns of a coming “fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries” of God – the same idea of consuming fire. Thus, the fate of the wicked, though sometimes delayed, is as sure as dry fat on an altar fire – they *will* burn up and vanish under God’s wrath.

## Psalm 40 (& 70) – Prayer for Enemies’ Confusion and Shame

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 40:14* — “Let them be **ashamed and confounded together** that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be **driven backward and put to shame** that wish me evil.” *(Psalm 70 is essentially the same prayer repeated.)*
* **Plain Interpretation:** David prays that those who are trying to kill him will be thwarted and **humiliated together**. He asks God to bring confusion upon them (“confounded”), so their plans collapse, and to make them retreat in disgrace. In modern terms: *“Lord, embarrass my attackers and make them turn tail in defeat. Let them be utterly shamed for plotting evil against me.”*
* **Context:** Psalm 40 is largely a thanksgiving for God’s past deliverance, but near the end (v.13–17) David voices a new urgent plea in the face of ongoing dangers. Verse 14 (and the following v.15) is an imprecation against malicious enemies. The fact that Psalm 70 repeats these lines verbatim shows how important and applicable this plea was – Psalm 70 is a stand-alone “memorial” psalm of petition, basically saying, *“God, hurry to help me; shame and confound my enemies”*. In Psalm 40, David is mindful of God’s mercy to him (he’s poor and needy, v.17) but asks God to deal firmly with those who would relish his downfall. “Ashamed and confounded” implies inner panic and outward disgrace. “Driven backward” pictures the enemy forces suddenly scattering or retreating in battle, instead of advancing. Together, the phrases paint the picture of an enemy rout orchestrated by God, where the very ones gloating over David’s trouble (v.15) are themselves shamed. This prayer aligns with the biblical principle that those who exalt themselves against God’s servant will themselves be brought low. David isn’t taking vengeance; he’s entrusting God to vindicate him by publicly defeating his foes.
* **Cross References:** As noted, *Psalm 70:2–3* repeats this exactly, confirming its importance in David’s worship and possibly common use in Israel’s prayers. The plea for enemies’ shame appears elsewhere: *Psalm 35:4* – “Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul,” almost identical language. *Psalm 35:26* again: “Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt.” The prophets too, like *Jeremiah 17:18*, pray “Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded.” In the New Testament, while direct imprecation is less common, *2 Thessalonians 1:6* affirms “it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you.” Thus, seeking God’s vindication against unrepentant enemies is presented as legitimate, leaving room for them to either repent or else face divine disgrace.

## Psalm 49 – Death is the Shepherd of the Rich Fool

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 49:14* — “Like sheep they are laid in the grave; **death shall feed on them**; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and **their beauty shall consume in the grave** from their dwelling.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** This wisdom psalm declares the grim fate of those who trust in riches rather than God. It says they are like a flock of sheep destined for **Sheol** (the grave), where **Death itself is their shepherd** feasting on them. At dawn (a metaphor for a new age or the resurrection morning), the godly will triumph over these wealthy fools. All the **splendor and beauty** the rich boasted in will rot away in the grave, far from their fancy homes. In short: those who live without understanding of God’s ways will die, be eaten by death like so much pasture, and lose all their glory, while the righteous outlast and outshine them.
* **Context:** Psalm 49 addresses the age-old question of why the wicked or ungodly rich often prosper. The sons of Korah (the authors) remind everyone that death is the great equalizer. In verses 6–13, they note that the rich cannot ransom their souls from death – they will die just like beasts. Verse 14 (quoted) graphically drives it home: the self-secure rich march to Sheol like dumb sheep, with **Death** personified as a shepherd feasting on them. “In the morning” suggests either the next life or simply the end of the dark night of this world – when the roles are reversed and the righteous (whom the rich may have oppressed or looked down on) will rule or rejoice. Verse 14’s second half paints the decay of the rich man’s body and legacy: even his form or “beauty” wastes away in the grave, no matter how stately his mansion was. Verse 15 contrasts that God will redeem the psalmist’s soul from the power of the grave. The overall context teaches not to envy the wealthy wicked: their prosperity is fleeting and their afterlife is terrifying. “Death shall feed on them” is among the strongest phrases in Scripture to describe the utter defeat of the godless in death.
* **Cross References:** Jesus illustrated this truth in *Luke 12:16–21*, the parable of the rich fool, who stored goods but died overnight – leaving everything. Jesus concluded, “So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.” Also *Luke 16:22–23* describes the rich man dying and being in torment, while the righteous (Lazarus) is comforted – a clear role reversal “in the morning” of eternity. *Job 21:13* notes the wicked often “spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave,” and *Job 21:26* “they shall lie down alike in the dust, and worms shall cover them.” Ultimately *1 Timothy 6:7* reminds us, “we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,” and *Hebrews 9:27* says after death comes judgment – confirming Psalm 49’s perspective that death strips the godless of all and delivers them to decay and judgment, whereas the upright have hope beyond the grave.

## Psalm 50 – “Consider This… Lest I Tear You in Pieces”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 50:22* — “Now **consider this**, ye that forget God, **lest I tear you in pieces**, and there be none to deliver.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** God Himself issues a dire warning: “Mark my words, you who neglect and dismiss Me – or I will rip you apart with no one to rescue you.” In straightforward terms, those who “forget God” (live as if He’s irrelevant) are told to pay attention and repent, because if they don’t, God will attack them like a ferocious lion tearing prey. And once His judgment begins, no one can save them from His hand.
* **Context:** Psalm 50 is a prophetic psalm where God convenes a courtroom with His people. First, He rebukes mere outward religion (sacrifice without obedience). Then, from verse 16 onward, He targets the “wicked” who recite His laws but cast His words behind them – hypocrites who associate with thieves, adulterers, and slanderers. They thought God’s silence meant approval (v.21). Verse 22 (above) is God’s thunderous wake-up call. “Consider this” means ponder and understand the seriousness of your situation. “Ye that forget God” refers to those living in willful disregard of God’s commandments despite being part of the covenant community. The phrase “tear you in pieces” is startling – God likens Himself to a wild beast (or a fierce warrior) in judgment. It’s the same imagery used in Hosea 5:14 where God says, “I will be unto Ephraim as a lion... I will tear and go away.” “None to deliver” underscores that when God is your enemy, there is absolutely no savior or escape. The final verse (v.23) then extends hope: whoever offers true praise and orders their conduct rightly will experience God’s salvation, implying that verse 22’s threat is designed to prompt repentance before it’s too late.
* **Cross References:** *Deuteronomy 32:39* God says, “there is none that can deliver out of my hand,” very similar to “none to deliver” here. The tearing imagery is found in *Hosea 13:7–8*, where God warns Israel He will be like a lion or bear tearing them for their rebellion. *Hebrews 10:31* alludes to this fearful prospect: “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” Also, *Nahum 1:6* asks, “Who can stand before His indignation?… His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by Him.” These verses collectively stress that once God’s wrath is unleashed, no human or idol can rescue the target. *Psalm 7:2* on a personal level had David praying that God not let an enemy “tear my soul like a lion” – here in Psalm 50, it is God who would become the lion to those who forgot Him. This warning stands among the sternest in Scripture to religious hypocrites and the complacent ungodly.

## Psalm 52 – “God Shall Likewise Destroy Thee Forever”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 52:5* — “**God shall likewise destroy thee for ever**, **he shall take thee away**, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and **root thee out of the land of the living**. Selah.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** Addressing a wicked man (in context, Doeg the Edomite), the psalmist pronounces that God will utterly annihilate him. In plain language: “God will strike you down once and for all. He’ll snatch you up, tear you from your house, and uproot you completely from the world of the living.” It emphasizes a **total**, permanent judgment – removed from home and life with no return.
* **Context:** Psalm 52 is a psalm of David regarding Doeg (who betrayed Ahimelech the priest and caused many deaths – see 1 Samuel 22). David begins by condemning the boaster who trusts in his mischief and deceit (v.1–4). In verse 5, David, with prophetic certainty, declares God’s forthcoming judgment on this evil person. The triple phrases intensify the completeness: “destroy forever” (not just temporary setback, but everlasting ruin), “take thee away” (sweep you up as in a storm), “pluck thee out of thy dwelling” (like pulling up a tent peg – evicting him forcefully from his house or even from his comfort zone), and “root thee out of the land of the living” (like a tree torn up roots and all, so he cannot grow again among the living). The *“Selah”* invites the listener to pause and picture that dramatic uprooting. Verses 6–7 then describe the righteous seeing this and fearing, and laughing at the downfall of such a man who “made not God his strength.” So this verse serves as the turning point: the man of evil will face irrevocable destruction at God’s hand, vindicating the righteous. It’s a stern warning to anyone who, like Doeg, uses lies and violence: your end will be being yanked out of life itself by God.
* **Cross References:** *Proverbs 2:22* similarly states, “the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.” The idea of being “rooted out… of the living” parallels that exactly. *Job 18:14* says of the wicked, “his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors” – being plucked from one’s tent to face death. Also *Psalm 37:35–36* observes a wicked, powerful man “spreading like a green bay tree,” yet he passed away and could not be found. In the New Testament, Jesus said every plant not planted by the Father will be rooted up (Matthew 15:13). Doeg’s personal fulfillment may not be recorded in Scripture, but David’s prophecy would assure the faithful that such a man did meet a calamitous end. Ultimately, “destroy… forever” points to eternal judgment – which in Christian understanding is hell (2 Thessalonians 1:9 speaks of the wicked “punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord”).

## Psalm 54 – God Will Repay and Cut Off My Enemies

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 54:5* — “**He shall reward evil unto mine enemies**: cut them off in thy truth.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** David expresses confidence that God Himself will repay his enemies for the evil they’ve done. “Reward” here means **repay** or return their wickedness back on them. In simpler terms: “God will give my enemies the evil they deserve.” The phrase “cut them off in Your truth” is a prayer or assertion that in God’s faithfulness and justice (“truth”), He will *cut off* (destroy, eliminate) all those hostile to David. It’s both a declaration of what God will do and an appeal for God to do it faithfully.
* **Context:** Psalm 54 was written when the Ziphites betrayed David to Saul. David begins by asking for God’s name (power) to save him. By verse 4 he affirms, “Behold, God is mine helper.” Then verse 5 (above) voices his assurance that God’s help includes taking care of his adversaries. This short psalm mixes prayer and confidence. The “enemies” in context are not just personal foes but men opposing God’s anointed and by extension opposing God’s will. David entrusts vengeance entirely to the Lord: *God* will handle the payback. “Cut them off in thy truth” implies that because God is true to His promises (perhaps the promise to protect His servant or to judge the treacherous), He will eliminate these traitors. It’s akin to saying: according to Your faithfulness to justice, wipe them out. In the final verse 7, David anticipates looking in triumph on his foes. This psalm, while personal, sets a pattern: believers can rely on God to avenge wrongs and rightfully punish those who do evil against them. It encourages leaving room for God’s wrath rather than taking revenge (similar to Romans 12:19).
* **Cross References:** *2 Thessalonians 1:6* states a New Testament equivalent: “It is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you.” That mirrors “He shall reward (repay) evil unto my enemies” exactly. *Deuteronomy 7:10* says God “repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them.” The phrase “cut them off” is common in Psalms for ending someone’s life or lineage (see Psalm 94:23 or Psalm 37:9). Also, *Psalm 118:7* has a similar tone: “God taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.” All these show the biblical principle that God’s truth/faithfulness includes carrying out retribution on unrepentant enemies of His people. David’s phrase “in thy truth” could also be rendered “by your faithfulness” – meaning God’s loyal commitment to His servant guarantees the enemies’ defeat (cf. *Psalm 57:3*, “God shall send forth His mercy and His truth” to save David, and thereby put down his foes).

## Psalm 55 – Let Death Seize the Treacherous

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 55:15* — “**Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell**: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** David calls for sudden, catastrophic judgment on his enemies (who were once friends turned traitors, according to the psalm context). He basically prays: “Let death come upon them unexpectedly; let them go down alive into **Sheol** (the grave/hell).” Saying “go down quick (alive) into hell” means being swallowed up by the earth or dragged to death without the natural course – reminiscent of a supernatural judgment. He justifies this by pointing out the abundant evil in their houses and hearts. In essence: *May God send these wicked traitors straight to the grave as He did with past rebels (like Korah), because they are utterly filled with violence and deceit.*
* **Context:** Psalm 55 reveals David’s deep pain over a close friend’s betrayal (v.12–14, likely referring to Ahithophel during Absalom’s rebellion, or someone similar). David describes the turmoil in the city caused by this treachery (v.9–11) and the hypocrisy of his betrayer. By verse 15 (the imprecation above), David pours out a curse on those conspirators: he invokes the precedent of *Numbers 16:30–33*, where **Korah** and his followers went down alive into Sheol as the earth opened. “Go down quick (alive) into hell” is almost a direct reference to that event. David, feeling the sting of betrayal, asks God for a similarly dramatic judgment. “Wickedness is in their dwellings” pictures these people plotting evil at home, perhaps offering hospitality while planning violence (v.21 notes their speech was smoother than butter but war was in their heart). Such entrenched treachery warrants extraordinary punishment. While it sounds harsh, David is appealing to God’s justice against covenant-breakers and violent traitors. After this verse, David shifts to express trust in God (v.16–18) and encouragement to cast cares on the Lord (v.22). The psalm ends affirming that God will “bring *them* down into the pit of destruction” (v.23), echoing the curse of verse 15 in more certain terms.
* **Cross References:** The prime cross reference is *Numbers 16:30, 33*, where Moses said if the rebels die unusually by the earth swallowing them alive, then it’s God’s sign – and it happened: “They… went down alive into the pit.” David is clearly invoking that imagery. Another relevant passage is *Proverbs 28:17*: “a man that doeth violence… shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him” – i.e. such a person rushes toward death. In the New Testament, while believers are taught to bless enemies (Romans 12:14), we see God’s swift judgment on certain wicked individuals (e.g. *Acts 5:5*, Ananias falls dead; *Acts 12:23*, Herod is struck down by an angel of the Lord and dies). These underscore that God can indeed “seize” someone in sudden death for their wickedness. Ultimately, *Revelation 21:8* warns that all unrepentant liars, murderers, etc., will have their part in the “lake of fire,” essentially going down to hell – the final answer to such prayers for justice if not fulfilled in this life.

## Psalm 58 – “The Righteous Shall Rejoice When He Sees the Vengeance”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 58:10* — “The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: **he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** This striking verse says that when God carries out vengeance on the wicked, the godly will **rejoice** at justice being done. The imagery “wash his feet in the blood of the wicked” is hyperbolic and graphic – it means there will be such an overthrow of the wicked that their blood will be as plentiful as water to bathe in. In other words: the righteous will triumph so completely over the wicked (by God’s doing) that they figuratively step over the defeated wicked, drenched in the evidence of God’s judgment. It emphasizes the *totality* of the wicked’s defeat and the *satisfaction* of the righteous at God’s righteous judgment.
* **Context:** Psalm 58 is an imprecatory psalm aimed at unjust rulers (“ye congregation…judge uprightly?” v.1). David condemns these powerful wicked people who pervert justice – calling them venomous serpents (v.3–5). He then prays for God to break their teeth and destroy them swiftly (v.6–9). Verse 10 (above) is the outcome: when God answers by executing wrath, the righteous respond with joy at evil’s downfall. This isn’t gloating over personal enemies out of hatred; it’s a celebratory affirmation that God’s justice has prevailed on the earth. “Washing feet in blood” may allude to victors walking through the battlefield after God’s judgment on enemies (an image also used in Isaiah 63:3 for God’s winepress of wrath). It’s gruesome to modern ears, but in ancient context it conveys *poetic justice*: the wicked who shed innocent blood now have their own blood poured out, and the people of God are vindicated. Verse 11 follows: “So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily He is a God that judgeth in the earth.” Thus, the rejoicing is fundamentally about the proof of God’s governance and moral order.
* **Cross References:** *Deuteronomy 32:42* God says, “I will make My arrows drunk with blood, and My sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives,” showing God’s vengeance in battle – a similar intensity of imagery. *Revelation 16:6* reflects the idea of poetic justice: those who shed the blood of saints are given blood to drink by God’s judgment. Also, *Revelation 18:20* and *19:1–2* depict the heavenly rejoicing over the downfall of Babylon (symbol of wicked power) because God avenged the blood of His servants. In terms of saints “rejoicing” at judgment, *Revelation 19:17–18* portrays the aftermath of Armageddon where the birds eat the flesh of the wicked – gruesome but indicating total victory, much as Psalm 58:10 indicates with the feet-washing metaphor. These cross references affirm that it is righteous to rejoice not in the suffering itself, but in the **justice of God** finally being manifested against persistent evildoers.

## Psalm 59 – “Consume Them in Wrath till They Are No More”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 59:13* — “**Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be**: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** David prays with urgent intensity for God to **consume** (destroy) his enemies in His righteous anger – repeating “consume them” for emphasis. “That they may not be” means *so that they cease to exist*. In today’s words: “Wipe them out in your wrath, O God; wipe them out completely, so that they’re gone.” This ultimate destruction also serves a purpose: to demonstrate to all people everywhere (“unto the ends of the earth”) that God reigns over Israel (Jacob) and by implication over all nations. It’s a plea for a decisive act of judgment that not only protects David but also glorifies God as the universal ruler.
* **Context:** Psalm 59 was written when Saul’s men watched David’s house to kill him (1 Samuel 19). David calls his enemies “bloodthirsty men” (v.2) who howl like dogs at night (v.6, 14). Throughout, he asks for deliverance, but in verses 11–13 he specifically prays about *how* God should deal with them. In verse 11 he says, “Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them…” wanting a memorable judgment. By verse 13, he escalates to asking for total consumption. The repetition “consume them in wrath, consume them” shows the fervor and finality he seeks. This might reflect that a mere scattering or partial judgment (v.11) is not enough; ultimately, he desires the threat eliminated (“that they may not be”). The result he seeks is pedagogical – that all will recognize God’s sovereignty. The Selah after verse 13 invites the listener to pause and imagine the completeness of this divine wrath. Immediately after, in verses 16–17, David shifts to praising God for His strength and mercy, implying confidence that God will indeed answer. Thus, verse 13 stands as the climax of the imprecation: these traitors and assassins will be dealt with in such a way that the whole world knows Israel’s God is King.
* **Cross References:** The cry to “consume” enemies is reminiscent of *Psalm 57:3* where David said God would “send forth his mercy and his truth” to save him – mercy to David, truth (or faithfulness to promises) often implies judgment on enemies. Also *Psalm 37:20* (quoted earlier) says the wicked “shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away”, which is essentially what David prays for here. The desire that nations know “God rules in Jacob” echoes Moses’ plea in *Exodus 32:12–13* that God act for His name’s sake among nations. It also looks forward to God’s universal reign theme: *Psalm 46:10* “I will be exalted among the heathen.” In the New Testament, *2 Thessalonians 2:8* uses similar language of Jesus’ second coming: He “shall consume” the lawless one “with the breath of His mouth” – an utter, undeniable destruction that reveals Christ’s rule. Thus, David’s prayer aligns with the pattern that God’s judgments are ultimately meant to reveal His kingship to all (see also *Isaiah 52:10*, the Lord makes bare His arm so all ends of the earth see the salvation of God – here judgment is the flipside of that revelation).

## Psalm 68 – “Let God Arise, Let His Enemies Be Scattered”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 68:1–2* — “Let God arise, **let his enemies be scattered**: let them also that hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away, so **drive them away**: as wax melteth before the fire, so **let the wicked perish at the presence of God**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** In this triumphant song, the psalmist calls for God to **rise up** in power. The immediate effect: His enemies will be thrown into disarray and **scatter** in all directions. All who hate God will *flee* from His face. He gives two similes: first, as wind drives away **smoke** (which vanishes into thin air), so God should blow His foes away to nothing; second, as **wax** figures melt and dissolve when near a flame, so the wicked will **melt and perish** when God shows up. In simple terms: when God marches forth, every enemy evaporates or melts in defeat – they cannot stand His presence and are obliterated.
* **Context:** Psalm 68 is a victory processional psalm, possibly commemorating the ark’s journey or God’s past deliverances (some connect it to David bringing the ark to Zion). It celebrates God as a warrior and defender of His people. The opening words deliberately echo Moses’ ancient invocation whenever the ark set out: *“Rise up, O **LORD**, and let thine enemies be scattered”* (Numbers 10:35). Thus, verse 1 invokes that tradition – the people would chant it when God’s presence (symbolized by the ark) moved to lead them. Verse 2 elaborates on the fate of God’s adversaries: they are completely powerless, disappearing like smoke and melting like wax. This sets the tone for the whole psalm – God drives out kings (v.12), crushes enemies’ heads (v.21), and brings His people to victory. It’s both a prayer and a confident assertion of what happens when the Almighty acts. Notably, the next verses (3–4) contrast that the righteous rejoice exceedingly. So, the scattering of enemies (v.1–2) is the flip side of deliverance for the faithful. In a broader spiritual sense, it portrays how evil cannot withstand the manifest presence of God.
* **Cross References:** The imagery here appears elsewhere: *Isaiah 64:1–2* prays similarly, “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens… that the mountains might flow down… as when the melting fire burneth… to make thy name known to thine adversaries.” Also, *Psalm 18:8* speaks of smoke and fire from God’s nostrils when He arises in anger. Historically, *Judges 5:31* (Song of Deborah) echoes, “So let all thine enemies perish, O **LORD**: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.” That is very much in line with this psalm’s opening. *Nahum 1:5–6* says the mountains melt before God – similar to wax melting. And ultimately, *Revelation 19:1–3* shows heaven rejoicing as God scatters and judges the great enemy “Babylon,” with her smoke rising forever (smoke driven away reminds us that even mighty empires become smoke under God’s judgment). Thus, Psalm 68:1–2 stands as a classic proclamation of God’s undefeatable power to rout every foe, used in Israel’s worship and echoed throughout Scripture.

## Psalm 69 – A Torrent of Curses on Persecutors

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 69:24* — “**Pour out thine indignation upon them**, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.” *(Followed by further curses: “Let their habitation be desolate…,” “Add iniquity unto their iniquity…,” “Let them be blotted out of the book of the living…,” etc. in verses 25–28.)*
* **Plain Interpretation:** This is one of Scripture’s strongest imprecations. David asks God to **dump** His burning anger on his enemies, letting the full fury of divine wrath overtake them. In modern phrasing: “God, pour out your rage on them; let your fierce anger grip and consume them.” And indeed the verses that follow specify what that wrath should look like: their homes deserted, sin piling on sin with no forgiveness, and their very names erased from the roster of the living (meaning they should die and not be counted among the righteous). Essentially, David is invoking total divine judgment – physical desolation, spiritual judgment, and memorial obliteration.
* **Context:** Psalm 69 is a messianic psalm of lament (parts are applied to Jesus’ suffering in the New Testament, e.g. v.9 about zeal for God’s house, v.21 about vinegar for thirst). David is in deep distress, hated without cause (v.4), enduring reproach for God’s sake (v.7). After pleading for rescue, by verse 22 he shifts to praying judgment on his adversaries. He prays their table becomes a trap (v.22 – Paul cites this in Romans 11:9–10 regarding those who rejected Christ), their eyes darkened (v.23). Verse 24 (above) is the climax: calling for God’s furious anger. Then he continues: let their place be empty (v.25 – cited in Acts 1:20 about Judas), let them be unforgiven (v.27), and let them be blotted from the book of life and not included with the righteous (v.28). These are extremely heavy words – essentially asking God to damn them. Why? Verse 26 explains: “For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.” In other words, these people heap pain on one already struck by God (or already suffering), showing cruel, unrepentant hearts. David’s zealous plea reflects his sense of the grievousness of their sin. By the end (v.30+), he returns to praise, indicating he’s left the fate of his foes with God. This set of curses is unique in its breadth and intensity, showing the depths of righteous anger against persistent, hardened persecutors – it foreshadows the judgment on those who reject the ultimate Sufferer, Christ.
* **Cross References:** Many of these imprecations came to be seen as prophetic. *Romans 11:9–10* uses Psalm 69:22–23 regarding Israel’s hardness – their blessings (table) became a snare, eyes darkened. *Acts 1:20* applies v.25 (“let his habitation be desolate”) to Judas, who indeed met desolation. “Blotted out of the book of the living” echoes *Exodus 32:32–33* where God tells Moses He will blot out of His book those who sinned against Him. Ultimately, *Revelation 3:5* contrasts that the overcomer’s name will *not* be blotted out, implying the wicked’s will. The idea of *no forgiveness* (“add iniquity unto iniquity”) is sobering – *Mark 3:29* speaks of an eternal sin (blasphemy of Holy Spirit) never forgiven. This aligns with the notion of utter hardening. Finally, “pour out thine indignation” is seen in *Jeremiah 10:25*, which interestingly is a plea to pour wrath on heathen that know not God – nearly identical phrasing to Psalm 69:24, showing this imprecation was used for extremely wicked peoples. In sum, Psalm 69’s curses underscore that there is a point of no return where only fearful judgment remains (Hebrews 10:26–27).

## Psalm 71 – “Let Them Be Confounded and Consumed”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 71:13* — “Let them be **confounded and consumed** that are adversaries to my soul; let them be **covered with reproach and dishonour** that seek my hurt.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist (an older David or another elderly believer) prays that his enemies who attack his life would end up **confused** (thwarted and ashamed) and ultimately **consumed** (finished off). He asks that those who want to harm him be clothed with public shame and dishonor. In simple terms: *“God, put my enemies to ruin – frustrate them, destroy them, and make them wear their disgrace like a cloak.”*
* **Context:** Psalm 71 appears to be written by someone in old age (v.9, “cast me not off in the time of old age”). He has many enemies who see him as vulnerable (v.10–11). Throughout, he asks God for continued deliverance and affirms lifelong trust. Verse 13 (above) is the only imprecatory line in this psalm; it comes amid pleas for help. The request “confounded” implies psychological defeat and humiliation, “consumed” suggests physical or existential defeat. Essentially, he’s praying that his oppressors meet with utter failure and ruin. “Covered with reproach and dishonour” implies that their plots boomerang – instead of the psalmist being shamed (their goal), they themselves become a proverb of shame. This is a common theme: those who try to shame the righteous end up being shamed by God. After this verse, the psalm swiftly returns to praising God’s faithfulness and power (v.14–24), indicating the writer’s confidence that God will indeed handle the opposition. It’s worth noting that this psalm doesn’t identify the enemies specifically or ask for personal vengeance; it’s a general plea for God to uphold justice for His servant. The use of imprecation in verse 13 highlights that even in old age and gentle trust, the psalmist still yearns for God’s righteous judgment on persistent evildoers.
* **Cross References:** This line is very reminiscent of earlier Davidic psalms: *Psalm 35:4* (“Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul”) and *Psalm 35:26*. Also *Psalm 40:14* (cited above) uses the same “ashamed and confounded” phrasing. The concept of God clothing the wicked with dishonor appears in *Psalm 109:29*: “Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion.” In the prophets, *Isaiah 41:11* promises the enemies of God’s servant will be “ashamed and confounded… they shall be as nothing, and they that strive with thee shall perish.” And *Isaiah 45:24* declares all incensed against the Lord “shall be ashamed.” These parallels show that Psalm 71:13 is part of a consistent biblical hope: that God will vindicate the faithful by publicly shaming and eliminating the threat of the wicked. The prayer was not vindictive glee, but a longing that truth and justice prevail visibly.

## Psalm 73 – Sudden Desolation for the Proud Wicked

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 73:18–19* — “Surely thou didst set them in **slippery places**: thou castedst them down into **destruction**. **How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!** they are utterly **consumed with terrors**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** After struggling with why the wicked prosper, Asaph realizes their end. He exclaims to God: “Truly, you’ve put those arrogant sinners on slick, slippery ground. In the blink of an eye, they slide and crash to ruin! How suddenly they’re destroyed – completely swept away by dreaded calamity!” In other words: the wicked may stand tall for a while, but God has placed them in precarious circumstances ready to fall. When God acts, their downfall is instant and horrifying, leaving them finished and terrified.
* **Context:** Psalm 73 is a testimony of Asaph, who envied the prosperity of the wicked until he “went into the sanctuary of God” and understood their latter end (v.17). Verses 18–19 are the insight he gained from God: the outward success of the proud, violent wicked is a slippery illusion. The phrase “slippery places” contrasts with the “firm ground” the righteous desire. It implies that the wicked walk on greased paths – at any moment, they can slip. “Cast down to destruction” indicates God actively throws them to ruin when the time comes. The abruptness (“as in a moment”) is emphasized: one minute they are healthy, wealthy, and boasting, the next they are destroyed – maybe through death or disaster. “Consumed with terrors” paints the final experience of the wicked as one of fear and annihilation, perhaps alluding to the terror of suddenly facing God’s judgment. Asaph goes on to realize that his earlier envy was foolish, because in reality, the wicked’s prosperity is transient and their doom is certain. The psalm ends with Asaph affirming that closeness to God is his true good, unlike the wicked who perish far from Him (v.27 – “those far from Thee shall perish”). So verses 18–19 serve as the turning point: God’s justice may be delayed, but when it strikes, it is decisive and dreadful for the wicked.
* **Cross References:** The imagery of slippery places is also used in *Jeremiah 23:12* regarding false prophets – God says their way shall be slippery in the darkness, they shall fall. *Psalm 37:*\*\* (the whole psalm) parallels this message – the wicked spread like a green tree, then vanish (Psalm 37:35–36). Specifically *Psalm 37:18–20* assures the upright are upheld while the wicked perish like fat drippings into smoke, which corresponds to Asaph’s realization. *Job 21:29–30* acknowledges that the wicked are reserved for the day of destruction and brought forth to wrath. *Luke 12:20* (the rich fool parable) – “This night your soul shall be required of you” – exemplifies the sudden reversal: a moment turns abundance into loss and fear. Finally, *1 Thessalonians 5:3* warns “when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them… and they shall not escape.” Asaph’s spiritual epiphany in Psalm 73 echoes through these scriptures: no matter how stable the wicked seem, their crash will be sudden and irreversible under God’s hand.

## Psalm 75 – A Cup of Foaming Wine for the Wicked

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 75:8* — “For in the hand of the **LORD** there is a **cup**, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but **the dregs thereof**, **all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** As part of God’s judgment, He holds a cup of potent, spiced wine (a metaphor for His wrath). God is already pouring it out for people to drink. The wicked – *every* wicked person on earth – *must* drain this cup to the last drop, even the nasty sediment (**dregs**) at the bottom. In simple terms: God has a chalice of judgment wine ready, and every wicked man and woman will be forced to drink it down completely, experiencing the full bitter wrath of God with nothing left out.
* **Context:** Psalm 75 is a song of Asaph, thanking God for being the Judge who puts down one and exalts another (v.7). It speaks of God’s appointed time to judge uprightly (v.2). Verse 8 (above) vividly describes how God’s wrath works: like making the wicked drink a cup of strong, spiced wine. In ancient times, mixing spices into wine made it more intoxicating or potent. The “red” likely implies its strength or richness. “He poureth out of the same” suggests God is already distributing judgment. Crucially, “all the wicked of the earth” — it’s universal in scope — “shall wring them out” indicates they must drain the dregs by themselves. The picture is of unwilling drinkers having to tilt the cup and squeeze out the last bitter drops to consume them. This ensures no portion of wrath is left untasted by the wicked. Right after this, verse 9–10 moves to the psalmist’s response: he will declare God’s works; the wicked’s horns will be cut off, but the righteous exalted. The cup imagery is common for God’s judgment (see references below). It assures that however prideful the wicked (v.4–5 talked about warning the proud), they cannot escape the destiny God has prepared – a destiny of drinking judgment to its fullest.
* **Cross References:** The “cup of God’s wrath” is a recurring biblical symbol. *Isaiah 51:17* and *22* speak of “the cup of trembling… the cup of my fury” which Jerusalem drank, but God promises to take it from them and put it into the hands of their tormentors. *Jeremiah 25:15–16* directly parallels Psalm 75: God gives Jeremiah a cup of wine of wrath and tells him to make *“all the nations”* drink it; if they refuse, Jeremiah is to tell them they must drink. *Lamentations 4:21* likewise says Edom will be drunk and stripped as the cup passes to them. In the New Testament, *Revelation 14:10* warns that whoever worships the beast “shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation.” (Note: “without mixture” here means full strength, exactly the idea of fully experiencing the wrath as in Psalm 75.) Finally, even Jesus used the metaphor in Gethsemane: “Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me” – He refers to the cup of suffering and wrath He would drink on behalf of sinners. So, Psalm 75:8 stands squarely in a strong tradition: God’s judgment is like a heavy, spiced wine that the wicked *must* drink every drop of – a graphic guarantee that none of the wicked will go unpunished or get only a partial penalty.

## Psalm 76 – Who Can Stand Before Your Anger?

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 76:7* — “Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and **who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?**”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist addresses God: “You, yes You alone, are awesome and worthy of reverence. When Your anger ignites, **who can possibly stand up against You?**” In simple terms: when God’s wrath breaks out, no one has the strength or ability to withstand Him. All must crumble or flee – there is zero chance of enduring His furious judgment. It’s a rhetorical question expecting the answer “no one.”
* **Context:** Psalm 76 celebrates a dramatic deliverance of God (likely the defeat of Sennacherib’s army in Hezekiah’s time, where an angel slew 185,000 Assyrian troops in one night, see Isaiah 37:36). The psalm speaks of God’s abode in Zion and how He broke the weapons of war (v.2–3). Verse 7 (above) is the heart of the psalm’s lesson: God’s presence and anger are terrifying. In verses 5–6 it described stout-hearted warriors who were plundered and slept their final sleep because of God’s rebuke – horses and chariots frozen (likely alluding to that miraculous defeat). So by verse 7, the psalmist exclaims that God is fearsome, and when His wrath flares, no one – not even the mightiest – can remain standing. It implies all fall prostrate or are destroyed. This rhetorical question emphasizes humans’ frailty under divine wrath. Verses 8–9 continue that from heaven God pronounced judgment and the earth feared and was still, when God arose to save the meek. This shows that God’s anger was in defense of the humble; it resulted in peace after He shattered the proud. Verse 10 interestingly states that even human wrath will ultimately praise God, and the remainder of wrath He restrains. But verse 7’s question stands as a timeless truth echoed elsewhere: in judgment, God’s power is unopposed and overwhelming. It calls readers to *fear God* and not pridefully resist Him.
* **Cross References:** Similar questions are posed in Scripture: *Nahum 1:6* asks, “Who can stand before His indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of His anger? His fury is poured out like fire…” – almost exactly Psalm 76:7’s sentiment. *Malachi 3:2* also: “But who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth?” – referring to God’s refining judgment. In the New Testament, *Revelation 6:16–17* has the kings and mighty men calling to mountains, “Hide us… from the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day of His wrath is come; and **who shall be able to stand?**” clearly echoing this psalm. *Job 41:10* God says of Leviathan (symbolic of a powerful creature or even Satan), “none is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before Me?” – meaning if you fear a creature, how much more the Creator. All these reinforce that **no one** – no army, no proud king, no demonic force – can stand when God rises in wrath. The only refuge is to be at peace with Him (Psalm 76:11–12 urges vows and gifts to God and notes He cuts off princes who won’t yield).

## Psalm 79 – “Pour Out Thy Wrath on the Heathen”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 79:6–7* — “**Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen** that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. **For they have devoured Jacob**, and laid waste his dwelling place.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** Asaph (the psalmist) implores God to **empty the full fury** of His anger on the Gentile nations that do not acknowledge Him. In modern speech: “God, unleash Your wrath on those pagan nations that don’t know You or honor You. They’ve ravaged Your people Israel (‘Jacob’) and destroyed our homeland – so pay them back in kind.” The plea is rooted in the brutality these nations showed – they “devoured” God’s people like wild beasts and ruined the holy city and temple (context of Psalm 79 is the aftermath of Jerusalem’s destruction). Thus the psalm calls for divine vengeance on those responsible.
* **Context:** Psalm 79 is a lament likely written after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. The sanctuary is defiled, Jerusalem in ruins, and bodies lie unburied (v.1–4). The psalm alternates between grief, confession, and pleas for God to act. Verses 5–6 ask how long God’s anger at Israel will last and then pivot to ask God to turn that anger toward the *nations* that have done this horror. Verse 6 (above) specifically names the target of wrath: gentile kingdoms that don’t call on Yahweh. It’s acknowledging these invaders are not just political foes but spiritual outsiders who mocked God. Verse 7 gives the justification: they have mercilessly consumed Jacob (a name for Israel) and ruined his home (the Promised Land, especially Jerusalem). The psalmist is thus appealing to God’s justice – if God punished His own people (for their sins) using these nations, now it’s time to punish the overzealous, cruel instrument (cf. Zechariah 1:15, God was angry at the nations that “furthered the disaster”). Later in the psalm (v.10,12), he again asks God to repay these neighbors sevenfold for their reproach of God. It’s a raw cry for God to visibly avenge His people’s blood (v.10). In sum, verses 6–7 are essentially saying: “God, turn Your righteous anger on those godless destroyers – not on us anymore – because of the atrocities they’ve committed against Your covenant people.”
* **Cross References:** This plea is almost identical to *Jeremiah 10:25*, which was likely written around the same time: “Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not… for they have eaten up Jacob…and made his habitation desolate.” This shows it was a common prayer of the exiles. *Lamentations 4:21–22* similarly concludes with Edom’s judgment after Jerusalem’s punishment: God’s wrath will pass from daughter Zion to punish Edom. *Isaiah 51:22–23* has God say He takes out of Jerusalem’s hand the cup of trembling (wrath) and will put it into the hand of her tormentors – a picture of this wrath transfer. In New Testament imagery, *Revelation 16:6* expresses a similar principle: those who shed the blood of saints will have blood to drink. And *2 Thessalonians 1:6* affirms it’s just for God to repay with tribulation those who trouble His people. Theologically, Psalm 79:6–7 appeals to God’s covenant loyalty: the nations that ravaged Israel (and defied God thereby) should not imagine they’ll escape divine reckoning.

## Psalm 82 – “You Shall Die Like Men” (Judgment on Unjust Rulers)

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 82:7* — “But **ye shall die like men**, and **fall like one of the princes**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** In this psalm, God is speaking to corrupt human judges or rulers whom He sarcastically called “gods” (v.6) due to their high office. He warns them: despite their exalted status, they will **die just like any other mortal**, and collapse like any other fallen prince. In essence: “Though you think yourselves godlike and untouchable, you will meet the fate of mortals – death – and topple as easily as any petty ruler who comes to ruin.” It strips them of any illusion of divine immunity.
* **Context:** Psalm 82 portrays a divine council scene where God stands to judge the “gods” – these are human authorities (Israel’s judges or rulers) entrusted with upholding justice (v.2–4 details their failures: showing partiality to the wicked, not defending the poor). In verse 6 God admits He gave them a godlike dignity and role (“I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High”, referencing their calling and authority under Him). Yet verse 7 (above) is the verdict: because they have perverted justice, they will lose their exalted position and **die like any other man**. “Fall like one of the princes” suggests they’ll be cast down from power and die shamefully like many aristocrats in history have. It’s possibly hinting at notorious deaths of princes known to the audience, thus: *Expect the same humiliating end as those princes who fell before you.* This warning emphasizes accountability – high status doesn’t exempt from God’s judgment. The final verse (v.8) then calls on God to arise and judge the earth, reinforcing that these unjust rulers will be replaced by God’s direct rule or by righteous judgment. So Psalm 82:7 is a key demotion statement – from “gods” to mere mortals destined to die. In theological terms, it’s a rebuke that even the mightiest are mortal and answerable to the Supreme Judge.
* **Cross References:** Jesus famously references Psalm 82:6 in *John 10:34–35* to illustrate that Scripture can use the term “gods” for those who received God’s word (judges), thereby defending His claim to be God’s Son. But focusing on Psalm 82:7’s sentiment: *Ezekiel 28:2,9* speaks to the Prince of Tyre who claimed to be a god: God says, “Yet thou art a man, and not God… you will die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers.” Very parallel in that a self-deifying ruler is reminded of mortality. *Isaiah 14:13–15* similarly mocks the King of Babylon who aspired to godhood: “I will exalt my throne above the stars of God… I will be like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.” In historical cases, *Acts 12:21–23* shows Herod Agrippa struck down by an angel and eaten by worms after accepting worship as a god – a direct “fall of a prince” scenario. And broadly, *Psalm 49:12* states, “Man in honor abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.” So Psalm 82:7’s message resonates with all these: no matter how high and mighty, unjust rulers will die like men. The fear of God and just dealing are the only safeguards, for God will not let human “gods” escape His sentencing.

## Psalm 83 – “Let Them Be Confounded and Perish”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 83:17* — “**Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist petitions God that the coalition of enemy nations attacking Israel be **thrown into eternal confusion and terror**. He basically prays: “May they be forever dismayed and distressed; yes, make them so ashamed of their failure that they die off.” In other words, he’s asking for a decisive divine rout – that these enemies experience lasting humiliation and ultimately destruction (perishing), such that they never rise against God’s people again.
* **Context:** Psalm 83 is a national lament and imprecatory psalm. Israel faces a confederacy of surrounding nations (listed in v.6–8) who plot to wipe out Israel’s name (v.4). The psalmist (Asaph) asks God to act as in past victories – like against Midian, Sisera, Jabin (v.9–11 recall Judges 4–8). He prays God would blow them like chaff and burn them like a forest fire (v.13–15). The purpose of these judgments, as given in v.16, is actually to lead them to seek God’s name in shame-induced repentance (“fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O **LORD**”). However, verse 17 (above) goes further: for those who persist, he prays for never-ending confusion and ultimately that they perish. This shows a two-fold hope: ideally, some enemies might turn to God, but those who will not (who continue their hatred) should be eradicated. The final verse (v.18) reveals the ultimate reason: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is **JEHOVAH**, art the most high over all the earth.” So, verse 17’s request is part of demonstrating God’s supremacy. By God shaming and destroying these conspiring nations, the world will recognize Israel’s God is sovereign. It is a prayer for an outcome like the defeat of Sennacherib or other miraculous deliverances, after which God’s fame spread. For the psalmist, Israel’s survival and God’s glory are intertwined; the utter defeat of these foes ensures both.
* **Cross References:** The phrase “confounded and troubled forever” echoes earlier psalms like *Psalm 35:4, 26* (“Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt”) and *Psalm 40:14*. It’s similar to *2 Chronicles 20:23–24* – in Jehoshaphat’s story, allied enemies turned on each other and were utterly routed, “none escaped,” which likely influenced Psalm 83’s imagery. The desire that they “perish” aligns with God’s promise that those who curse Abraham’s seed will themselves be cursed (Genesis 12:3). Conversely, *Isaiah 45:16* says idol-makers will be ashamed and confounded together, going to confusion. In prophetic vision, *Zechariah 12:9* God says He will seek to destroy all nations that come against Jerusalem – exactly what this psalm prays for. Ultimately, *Revelation 19:19–21* depicts the final confederation of nations against God being destroyed and thrown into the lake of fire – the ultimate answer to “let them perish.” Psalm 83 thus anticipates that pattern: God’s visible intervention to save His people by devastating their would-be destroyers, to the everlasting dismay of the wicked and the everlasting honor of His name.

## Psalm 92 – Flourishing Only to Be Forever Destroyed

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 92:7* — “When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that **they shall be destroyed for ever**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** This verse explains the short-lived success of the wicked. It says: If you see wicked people thriving and multiplying rapidly like grass in springtime, do not be fooled – their very abundance is a sign that they are **doomed to be destroyed forever**. In simpler terms: the only reason God allows the wicked to flourish briefly is to set them up for an everlasting ruin. Their prosperity is a prelude to their permanent destruction.
* **Context:** Psalm 92 is a song for the Sabbath, rejoicing in God’s works and justice. Verses 6–7 contrast the senseless ignorance of fools with God’s perspective: though the wicked sprout quickly and luxuriantly, their destiny is eternal destruction. This is meant to reassure the righteous that God’s judgment is not negated by temporary appearances. Verses 8–9 immediately follow: “But thou, **LORD**, art most high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O **LORD**, for, lo, thine enemies **shall perish**; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.” It reinforces verse 7’s point – the ultimate fate of God’s enemies is to perish, no matter how they appear now. The psalm then contrasts that with the righteous being exalted like a strong palm or cedar, still bearing fruit in old age (v.12–15). So, verse 7 is the turning point: outward flourishing of evil is deceptive; it actually confirms their judgment is coming. This principle echoes other wisdom literature that often puzzles over why the wicked prosper (like Psalm 73 which we saw). Psalm 92:7 provides a theological answer: God sometimes allows a short boom so that the bust – His judgment – is all the more decisive and their story ends completely. It underscores God’s sovereignty over time and outcome.
* **Cross References:** *Psalm 37:35–36* is a direct parallel: “I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.” *Job 20:5–8* similarly notes the triumph of the wicked is short and he perishes like dung, vanishing. *Proverbs 24:20* assures that “the evil man has no future (no reward); the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.” In the New Testament, *James 1:11* uses grass imagery: the rich man (without God) fades away in his pursuits, like grass withers under the sun. Isaiah often uses grass or flower metaphors for people’s transient life (Isaiah 40:6–8). Also *Malachi 4:1* again: the wicked will burn up like stubble leaving neither root nor branch – a flourishing to ashes scenario. Thus, Psalm 92:7 is part of a biblical theme: God may allow a speedy growth of evil, but only as fuel for a greater fall, ensuring that the final everlasting state is that evil is gone and the righteous stand vindicated.

## Psalm 94 – God Will Cut Off the Wicked

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 94:23* — “And **he shall bring upon them their own iniquity**, and shall **cut them off in their own wickedness**; yea, the **LORD** our God shall cut them off.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist concludes that God will make the wicked reap what they have sown. He will turn their sinful schemes back on their own heads (“bring upon them their iniquity”) and will **cut them off** (eliminate/destroy them) using the very evil they committed. In plain terms: *God will repay the wicked in kind and wipe them out by means of their own wickedness. Yes, the Lord will absolutely cut them off.* The repetition stresses the certainty of their fate.
* **Context:** Psalm 94 is an appeal to God as Judge to take vengeance on proud oppressors (v.1–2) who crush God’s people (v.5–6) and arrogantly think God doesn’t see (v.7). The psalmist affirms that God does see and will punish (v.8–11). He consoles the righteous that God will not forsake them (v.14) and will eventually give the righteous rest but bring the wicked to ruin (v.15, v.23). Verses 21–22 noted how the wicked gather against the just, but the Lord is the defense of the righteous. Then verse 23 (above) is the final pronouncement of doom for the wicked. “Bring upon them their own iniquity” reflects the biblical idea of poetic justice – their evil recoils on themselves. “Cut them off” means to destroy or remove from the community of the living (sometimes implying death or at least total defeat). Saying it twice (“shall cut them off… shall cut them off”) makes it emphatic: there is no doubt, the covenant God (“the **LORD** our God”) will see to it. This double assurance contrasts with the wicked’s earlier boast that “the God of Jacob doesn’t regard” (v.7). The psalmist ends by effectively saying: *Oh, He regards it all right – just wait and you’ll see Him utterly annihilate them in fitting fashion.* It’s a strong note of hope for the oppressed and a final warning to the wicked.
* **Cross References:** Many scriptures echo the “their own iniquity recoiling” theme. *Psalm 7:16* – “His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.” *Proverbs 5:22* – the wicked is held by the cords of his own sins. *Psalm 37:15* – the wicked’s sword shall enter their own heart. Also in narrative: *Esther 7:10*, Haman is hanged on the gallows he built for Mordecai – a literal fulfillment of bringing his iniquity on his head. “Cut off” is a common term: *Psalm 37:28* “the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.” *Proverbs 2:22* “the wicked shall be cut off from the earth.” Even prophetically, *Daniel 9:26* uses “cut off” as in removed or destroyed. In the New Testament, *Galatians 6:7* echoes the concept: “God is not mocked; whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.” And *Revelation 13:10* states, “He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword,” showing divine retribution in kind. Thus Psalm 94:23 assures believers of that moral equilibrium: evil will backfire and evildoers will be decisively removed by God’s own hand.

## Psalm 95 – Those Who Hardened Their Hearts Shall Not Enter God’s Rest

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 95:11* — “Unto whom I sware in my wrath that **they should not enter into my rest**.”
* **Plain-Language Interpretation:** God declares an oath He made in anger: *“I promised, in my righteous fury, that this stubborn people would **never enter the place of rest** I had prepared for them.”* In context, “my rest” refers to the promised rest of the Promised Land (Canaan) – so it means they would die in the wilderness and not enjoy that peace. In simpler terms: because they provoked God, He solemnly swore they would not reach the restful land – essentially, they’re banned from His rest due to disobedience.
* **Context:** Psalm 95 is an invitation to worship and also a warning. The first half (v.1–7a) joyfully calls people to praise God. The second half (v.7b–11) suddenly warns the congregation not to harden their hearts as Israel did at “Meribah” and “Massah” in the wilderness (Exodus 17, Numbers 20) when they tested God by complaining about water. Verse 10 recounts God’s indictment that for 40 years He was grieved with that generation, calling them erring in heart and ignorant of His ways. Then verse 11 (the quote above) is God’s resultant oath of judgment: that generation would not enter Canaan (see Numbers 14:26–30 where God swears none of the adults except Joshua and Caleb will enter the land). This historical example is used to exhort the current worshipers: *“Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts”* (v.7b–8). The implication is, just as unbelief and rebellion barred those Israelites from the promised rest, so will hardened hearts now bar one from God’s spiritual rest or blessings. The tone “I sware in my wrath” is solemn – it reminds that there *is* a point where God’s patience ends and His judgment becomes irrevocable. The psalm thus uses a past divine judgment as a standing warning: persistent unbelief will result in exclusion from God’s peace.
* **Cross References:** This verse is quoted extensively in *Hebrews 3:11* and *Hebrews 4:3*, 5 in application to Christian believers. Hebrews uses Psalm 95 to warn against unbelief and to explain that a “rest” still remains for God’s people – meaning the eternal rest – and that those who disobey (like that generation) will not enter it. *Numbers 14:23* and *Deuteronomy 1:34–35* record God’s oath: “Surely none of these men...shall see that good land.” So Psalm 95:11 is directly referencing those passages. *Ezekiel 20:15* also reiterates, “Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey…” – basically God swearing they wouldn’t enter Canaan. In a broader sense, *Isaiah 48:22* says, “There is no peace, saith the **LORD**, unto the wicked,” meaning the wicked have no share in God’s rest. And Jesus in *Matthew 11:28* offers, “Come unto me, all ye that labor… and I will give you rest” – implying that belief/coming to Christ is how one *enters* God’s rest, unlike the disobedient who forfeited it. The stark finality of “they shall not enter” serves as a cautionary tale from old to new covenants.

## Psalm 97 – Idolaters Ashamed, Enemies Burned Up

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 97:3* — “A **fire goeth before him**, and burneth up his enemies round about.” *(Also v.7: “**Confounded be all they** that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols…”)*
* **Plain Interpretation:** When God comes in judgment, a **fire** blazes in front of Him, incinerating all His foes on every side. In plain terms: wherever the Lord advances, His enemies are set ablaze and destroyed by consuming fire. Furthermore, all who worship idols – those false gods – will be **put to shame**; they’ll be mortified and defeated when the true God appears in glory. So, idolaters are left confounded, and adversaries are literally scorched.
* **Context:** Psalm 97 describes the reign of God as King over all the earth. It’s full of theophany imagery (God revealing Himself in creation’s convulsions). Verses 2–5 depict clouds, darkness, fire, lightning – elements often associated with God’s presence (like at Sinai). Verse 3 (above) specifically highlights fire as His vanguard, eliminating opposition. Verse 4–5 say the earth sees and trembles, and mountains melt like wax at His presence – showing unstoppable power. Then verse 7 (also noted) shifts focus to idolaters: when God shows up, those who trusted idols are embarrassed and disproven, and in fact, the “gods” (false gods or perhaps even angelic beings) must worship the Lord. This psalm rejoices that righteousness and justice are the foundation of God’s throne (v.2) – meaning His judgments are right. Thus, burning up enemies is not capricious but the execution of perfect justice. For the original audience, enemies could be both physical nations oppressing Israel and spiritual forces (idols, demonic powers behind them). The result of God’s self-revelation is that Zion (God’s people) hears and is glad (v.8) because God has triumphed. And it closes by encouraging the faithful that God preserves them while the wicked face His fire (v.10–12). In sum, verse 3 and 7 reassure believers that no enemy or false god can stand – all are consumed or shamed in the day of the Lord’s coming.
* **Cross References:** *Psalm 50:3* similarly says, “Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him.” This is a parallel vision of God’s approach with consuming fire. *Isaiah 66:15–16* also: “Behold, the **LORD** will come with fire… to render His anger with fury… by fire and by His sword will the **LORD** plead with all flesh: and the slain of the **LORD** shall be many.” *2 Thessalonians 1:8* describes Jesus’ return “in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God.” So the theme of divine fire against foes is consistent. As for idolaters being ashamed, *Isaiah 42:17* says, “They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images.” *Isaiah 45:16* similarly, and we saw *Psalm 97:7* reflect that. Ultimately, *Revelation 19:20* shows the beast and false prophet (ultimate idol leaders) cast into the lake of fire – the ultimate burning up of God’s enemies. And *Hebrews 12:29* reminds us, “our God is a consuming fire,” very much echoing this psalm. Thus, Psalm 97 gives a poetic snapshot of the day of the Lord – joyous for the righteous, terrifying flame for His enemies.

## Psalm 101 – “Early Will I Destroy All the Wicked of the Land”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 101:8* — “**I will early destroy all the wicked of the land**; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the **LORD**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** King David (the presumed author) vows that each morning (“early” meaning promptly and diligently) he will **wipe out every wicked person in the land** under his rule. His goal is to purge Jerusalem (“the city of the **LORD**”) of all evildoers, so that none of them remain in the holy city. In modern words: “Day after day, I will rid the country of evildoers. I will not rest until I have banished every last evil-doer from God’s city.” It’s a commitment to active, regular justice against the wicked.
* **Context:** Psalm 101 is a royal psalm, essentially David’s manifesto for righteous governance. Throughout, he describes the standards he will uphold in his house and kingdom: he’ll behave wisely (v.2), set no wicked thing before his eyes (v.3), hate perverseness, silence slanderers (v.5), not tolerate pride, honor the faithful of the land (v.6), and not endure deceit or lies (v.7). Verse 8 then summarizes his policy of enforcement – daily elimination of wicked people from Israel, especially from the capital where God’s temple would be. “Early” can imply each morning or swiftly/without delay. David is expressing zeal to maintain a purified society in line with God’s law. This verse underlines that his commitment isn’t just personal holiness but societal cleansing of evil. It likely targets criminals, corrupt officials, idolaters – any “wicked doers.” “City of the **LORD**” shows he sees Jerusalem as belonging to God, thus it must be kept holy. Historically, David did try to root out enemies of God (he executed foreign oppressors, traitors, etc.), and he planned a just administration. While the ideal is presented, one knows David’s reign wasn’t perfectly free of wicked people (e.g., Joab’s violence, etc.), but this psalm states the *standard and intention*. In broader interpretation, it foreshadows Messiah’s perfect reign when indeed all wickedness will be removed from Zion. It also provides a model for leaders: tolerating evil within one’s domain is unacceptable; prompt action is required.
* **Cross References:** *Deuteronomy 17:18–20* instructed a king to write a copy of God’s law and not turn from it, implying such purging of evil per the law’s demands. David’s practice echoes laws like *Deuteronomy 13:5* “thou shalt put the evil away from the midst of thee” (speaking of eliminating false prophets) and *Deuteronomy 19:19* (false witnesses). “Early destroy” is reminiscent of *Proverbs 20:26*: “A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them” (meaning he crushes them like grain under a threshing wheel). Also, *Exodus 32:20, 26–28* – Moses’ zeal after the golden calf, executing idolaters, sets a precedent for drastic action to purify the camp, which David mirrors in spirit. In a future sense, *Zechariah 13:2–3* speaks of removing idols and false prophets from the land in the Messianic age. And ultimately, *Revelation 21:27* says nothing impure will ever enter the New Jerusalem – *all* wicked doers are excluded, exactly as David aimed to “cut off” wicked doers from the earthly city of the Lord. Thus, David’s pledge in Psalm 101:8 is a type and shadow of God’s absolute standard: in His city/kingdom, no wickedness will be allowed to persist.

## Psalm 104 – “Let Sinners Be Consumed Out of the Earth”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 104:35* — “Let the sinners be **consumed out of the earth**, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the **LORD**, O my soul. Praise ye the **LORD**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist ends this nature hymn with a prayer and a praise. The prayer: “May all persistent sinners vanish from the earth, and may the wicked exist no longer.” In other words, he longs for a world cleansed of evil and evildoers – that God would remove them entirely. Immediately following that, he bursts into praise: “O my soul, bless the **LORD**! Hallelujah (Praise the **LORD**)!” This indicates he sees the elimination of the wicked as something that leads directly to pure praise of God, with creation in harmony.
* **Context:** Psalm 104 is a long celebration of God as Creator and Sustainer of the natural world. It marvels at God’s wisdom in creation, describing water, plants, animals, celestial cycles, sea creatures (even Leviathan), etc. There is almost no mention of sin or wickedness throughout – it’s about the ordered world. Notably, verse 31 expresses, “the glory of the **LORD** shall endure forever.” Only at the very end (verse 35) is there a sudden mention of “sinners” and “wicked.” This abrupt inclusion shows that in this idyllic praise of creation, the one discordant note is human sin, which mars creation’s harmony. So the psalmist, full of zeal for God’s glory and creation’s perfection, prays that sin and the wicked will be removed so nothing blights God’s world. Then the final lines bless God, returning to the tone of praise that dominates the psalm. It suggests that the psalmist’s ideal vision of the world is one where all creation praises God (as it implicitly does in the psalm) and no rebels remain. It’s a fitting end because earlier verses described lions, Leviathan, etc., all in their place – only humans in rebellion are out-of-place. Removing them leads to unbroken *“Hallelujah.”* This verse is often understood eschatologically – pointing to the new creation where indeed no wicked will exist.
* **Cross References:** *Psalm 37:10* promises “For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” This echoes “let the wicked be no more.” *Proverbs 2:22* again: the wicked “shall be cut off from the earth.” The sentiment “let the wicked be no more” is akin to longing for the final justice. *Malachi 4:1* speaks of the day coming that leaves the proud and wicked neither root nor branch – total removal. In the New Testament, Jesus’ parable of the wheat and tares (Matthew 13:40–43) ends with the tares (sons of the evil one) being burned at harvest, then the righteous shine – a scenario of sinners consumed out of the kingdom. *2 Peter 3:13* promises a new earth “wherein dwelleth righteousness,” implicitly with no wicked present. Finally *Revelation 21:27* we cited: nothing unclean or deceitful enters the New Jerusalem; and *Revelation 22:3* says “no more curse” there. Thus, Psalm 104:35 aligns with the biblical hope that God’s creation will ultimately be purged of evil, resulting in pure praise (“Praise ye the **LORD**”). It’s a prayer every believer can “Amen,” longing for the day when “Thy will be done on earth as in heaven” – with no opposition from sinners.

## Psalm 109 – David’s Imprecation: “Let His Days Be Few”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 109:8–9* — “**Let his days be few**; and **let another take his office**. **Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow**.” *(This is part of a longer curse from verse 6 to 15 listing many dire penalties for the enemy.)*
* **Plain Interpretation:** David calls down severe curses on a particular malicious enemy (traditionally thought to be a betrayer like Doeg or even prophetically Judas). He prays: “Cut his life short; remove him from his position of responsibility and let someone else take it. May he die such that his children are left as orphans and his wife as a widow.” In essence: *let him have a brief life and career, ending in an untimely death that devastates his family.* This is just the opening of an extensive curse list that includes prayers for his posterity to beg and vanish, for all memory of them to be erased. It is an extremely intense expression of desire for justice (or vengeance) against a cruel adversary.
* **Context:** Psalm 109 is one of the strongest imprecatory psalms. David laments being repaid evil for good (v.5) and then, starting at v.6, speaks of a singular enemy (using singular pronouns). He asks God to set a wicked man or Satan to oppose this person (v.6), to find him guilty in court (v.7), and then the verses above – to shorten his life and leadership (“office” can mean oversight or position). Notably, Acts 1:20 cites v.8 as prophetic of Judas Iscariot, applying “let another take his *office*” to Judas’ apostolic office . The cascade continues: may his children wander and beg (v.10), his creditors seize his assets (v.11), no mercy for his offspring (v.12), his lineage cut off (v.13), remembrance of them wiped out (v.15). David even prays that the sins of this man and his ancestors be remembered by God (v.14) – i.e. no forgiveness. The cause for such curses is given in v.16–20: this man mercilessly persecuted the poor and brokenhearted (likely including David), loved cursing (so David prays it returns on him), and refused to bless others. Thus, David essentially prays a *measure-for-measure* judgment: since the enemy loved to curse, “let curses soak into him like water and oil” (v.18). Verse 20 sums: “Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the LORD.” It’s deeply emotional and in line with lex talionis (law of retaliation). While we balk at the harshness (especially invoking suffering on his family), it reflects the view that such a man’s evil affects his whole house and thus justly rebounds on them too (common in OT imprecation). The psalm ends with David praising God for deliverance, implying trust that God will handle it.
* **Cross References:** As mentioned, *Acts 1:20* uses Psalm 109:8 for Judas, showing early Christians saw these curses as ultimately fulfilled on Christ’s betrayer (Judas died miserably and another, Matthias, took his place). Also *Psalm 55:15* which we covered (“Let death seize upon them…” about traitors) is similar in theme. The idea of “let another take his office” implicitly acknowledges God’s justice in leadership – a wicked leader’s position should be given to a righteous replacement (see *Proverbs 28:2* that a transgressor’s rule doesn’t last). The curses on children, while harsh, echo *Exodus 20:5* of God visiting iniquity to the children (interpreted as consequences of one’s sin affecting descendants). *Jeremiah 18:21* is interesting: Jeremiah, persecuted by people, prays, “deliver up their children to famine, and pour out their blood… let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows.” This is strikingly similar to David’s words, showing prophets also at times invoked such retribution. It illustrates the principle that those who cause many to be widows or orphans (by violence) should have the same visited on their own families (Exodus 21:23–25 style justice). In a New Testament sense, Christians are admonished to leave vengeance to God (Romans 12:19), but the concept that wickedness leads to ruin remains. Ultimately, Psalm 109, while difficult, shows raw zeal for justice against entrenched cruelty. Its specific curses (short life, lost office, etc.) found fulfillment in Judas, giving a sobering perspective: betraying the innocent can indeed result in a cursed legacy.

## Psalm 110 – Messiah Will Crush Kings in His Wrath

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 110:5–6* — “The Lord at thy right hand shall **strike through kings in the day of his wrath**. **He shall judge among the heathen**, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall **wound the heads over many countries**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** In this Messianic prophecy, it describes the Messiah (the Lord at God’s right hand) as a warrior-judge. When His day of wrath comes, He will **shatter kings**; He will execute judgment among the nations, leaving the battlefields **heaped with corpses**. He will crush the leaders (the “heads”) of many lands. Essentially: when Messiah comes in holy anger, no ruler or nation that opposes Him will stand – many will be slain, and the mightiest heads of state will be dealt a fatal blow. It’s a graphic portrayal of the Messiah’s total victory over all enemies.
* **Context:** Psalm 110 is a royal/Messianic psalm. Verse 1 is famous (“The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.”) – Jesus quoted it to confound the Pharisees about the Christ’s identity. Verses 2–3 speak of the Messiah’s scepter and His people offering themselves willingly. Verse 4 declares Messiah a priest forever after Melchizedek. Then verses 5–6 (above) depict His kingly judgment role. “The Lord at thy right hand” – if “thy” refers to God, then “Lord” refers to Messiah at God’s right hand (the position of power given to Messiah). The imagery is of a final day of wrath (something like the battle of Armageddon in eschatology). Striking through kings means an utter defeat of even the highest authorities. “He shall judge among the heathen” echoes Psalm 2 where Messiah breaks nations with a rod of iron. “Fill places with dead bodies” is stark, showing the scale of slaughter of the wicked armies. “Wound the heads over many countries” can mean either literal kings/political leaders are struck down, or metaphorically the chief of the enemy forces (some see an allusion to crushing the head of Satan’s realm – Genesis 3:15’s promise). In any case, it is a no-holds-barred description of conquest. This pairs with verse 1’s promise that all enemies will be footstool under His feet. Psalm 110 thus presents the Messiah not only as a priest but as a conquering king executing God’s vengeance. Christians interpret this as Christ’s second coming when He judges the world (*Revelation 19* strongly parallels this language). The severity underscores the absolute authority and holiness of the Messiah – He will not tolerate rebellion when the time of judgment arrives.
* **Cross References:** *2 Thessalonians 1:7–10* speaks of the Lord Jesus being revealed from heaven with mighty angels “in flaming fire taking vengeance” and punishing the disobedient – very much in line with Psalm 110:5’s “day of His wrath.” *Revelation 19:11–21* vividly fulfills this psalm: Christ (the rider on the white horse) strikes the nations with a sharp sword, treads the winepress of God’s wrath, the beast and kings of the earth make war and are slain, and “the fowls were filled with their flesh” – echoing “places filled with dead bodies.” Also, *Revelation 14:19–20* speaks of blood from the winepress up to horses’ bridles, showing carnage. The phrase “wound the heads” can parallel *Habakkuk 3:13* where God “woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked” or *Psalm 68:21* “God shall wound the head of His enemies”. And ultimately *1 Corinthians 15:25* says Christ “must reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet,” the final enemy being death. Thus, Psalm 110’s prophecy stands central in Messianic expectation: the priest-king who mercifully intercedes now will one day bring a decisive, violent end to all opposition. It’s both sobering and encouraging (for the righteous) – evil will not endure; the King of Kings will personally see to that.

## Psalm 112 – The Wicked Melt Away and Perish

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 112:10* — “The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall **gnash with his teeth, and melt away**: the desire of the wicked shall **perish**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** This psalm (which contrasts the blessings of the righteous with the fate of the wicked) ends by saying: when the wicked observe the prosperity and honor God gives the righteous (v.9), they will be vexed and angry (“grieved”). They will grind their teeth in furious envy, but it will do them no good – they will **waste away** to nothing. All the things the wicked longed for and schemed for (“the desire of the wicked”) will come to nothing; their hopes will **perish** along with them. In short: the wicked person can only fume helplessly as he dissolves in defeat, and all his ambitions evaporate.
* **Context:** Psalm 112 is an acrostic wisdom psalm describing the blessings of a God-fearing, generous man (v.1–9). It mirrors Psalm 111 in style. Verses 1–3 promise his offspring are mighty and his house blessed. Verses 4–9 detail his virtues (gracious, lends, not afraid of bad news, firm heart, honored by victory over foes, and he gives freely to the poor so his horn is exalted). Then verse 10 (above) provides the foil: the wicked man reacts to the righteous one’s blessed state. The wicked “sees it” – sees the upright man thriving and being honored – and this fills him with rage and despair. “Gnash his teeth” is a vivid phrase for extreme anger mixed with frustration (often used for those under judgment, e.g., Jesus uses it to depict the damned’s response). “Melt away” suggests the wicked’s power, perhaps even his physical self, dissolving. It contrasts with the righteous’ firm, enduring state (v.6 says the righteous will never be shaken). To melt away implies complete defeat and fading out. And his desires – all that he lusted after, be it wealth, power, triumph over the righteous – come to naught. That line might also hint at the wicked’s inner craving being unfulfilled and dying. So in context, Psalm 112:10 provides the counterpoint: while the righteous have an everlasting remembrance and honor, the wicked faces the humiliation of seeing his “enemy” blessed by God and then himself disappearing in impotent fury. This reinforces the recurring biblical theme that envy of the righteous leads the wicked nowhere, for God upholds the just and confounds the wicked.
* **Cross References:** The imagery of gnashing teeth in frustration appears in *Psalm 35:16* (wicked gnashed on me with their teeth out of hatred) and more so in New Testament: seven times in Matthew/Luke describing those cast out of God’s kingdom weeping and gnashing teeth (e.g., Luke 13:28) – indicating either anger or agony. “Melt away” reminds of *Psalm 37:20* (“the wicked…shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away”). It parallels that the wicked’s life and achievements dissipate like smoke. *Psalm 68:2* we saw: “as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God” – a close match. “Desire of the wicked shall perish” aligns with *Proverbs 10:28*: “The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.” Also *Job 8:13* “the hope of the hypocrite shall perish.” The wicked’s longings are usually for selfish or evil ends, which God ensures will not last. Ultimately, *1 John 2:17* says, “The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.” That captures Psalm 112’s message: righteous endures, wicked and their lusts fade. Thus, Psalm 112:10 encapsulates the outcome: frustrated, self-consuming ruin for the wicked, versus enduring blessing for the righteous (which the wicked hate to see but cannot prevent).

## Psalm 119 – “All the Wicked of the Earth… Like Dross”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 119:119* — “**Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross**: therefore I love thy testimonies.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** In this verse, the psalmist declares that God discards every wicked person on earth just as a metalworker discards **dross** (the impurities or slag separated out when refining metal). In other words: God sees the wicked as worthless refuse and removes them. Because the psalmist knows God deals with the wicked so decisively, he reaffirms his love for God’s laws (“testimonies”). The implication: God’s just treatment of the wicked – treating them as scum to be tossed – proves the rightness of His laws and makes the godly cling to those laws all the more.
* **Context:** Psalm 119, the longest psalm, is an acrostic love song to God’s Word. Throughout, the psalmist contrasts his devotion to God’s commands with the wicked who ignore or violate them. Many verses speak of persecutors, the arrogant, or the wicked who trouble the psalmist (e.g. v.85, “the proud have digged pits for me”). He often prays for deliverance and affirms that he won’t stray from God’s precepts despite their taunts (v.51) or threats (v.61). Verse 119 (above) comes in the section for letter Samekh (v.113–120). In this section, he states, “I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love” (v.113), God is his hiding place (v.114), he asks evildoers to depart from him (v.115), God upholds those who follow the law (v.117), and then verse 118–119: God has “trodden down all them that err from thy statutes” (v.118) and “put away all the wicked… like dross” (v.119). These verses together assert that God actively deals with those who stray from His Word by crushing them underfoot and removing them as impurities from the earth. Finally, v.120 says, “My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.” So the knowledge of God’s severe judgment on the wicked evokes reverent fear in the psalmist, deepening his commitment to God’s Word. Verse 119’s imagery is potent: in smelting, dross is the scummy byproduct drawn off and cast aside – that’s how God handles persistent rebels against His law. This concept encourages the faithful (their oppressors won’t last) and warns everyone to stay true to God’s commands. It also underscores the psalm’s theme: loving God’s law is life, deviating from it leads to being discarded.
* **Cross References:** *Ezekiel 22:18–22* uses the same metaphor: God calls Israel “dross” (impurities of bronze, tin, iron) and says He’ll gather them into the furnace of Jerusalem and melt them in His wrath – literally treating them as dross. *Malachi 3:2–3* speaks of the Lord as a refiner and purifier, purging away dross so that only pure metal remains (there it’s actually to purify the righteous remnant, but the wicked would be the “dross” removed). *Proverbs 25:4–5* says, “Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.” That equates removing wicked from society with removing dross from silver to strengthen a kingdom – similar to God removing wicked from the earth for a righteous world. Also, *Matthew 13:41–43* speaks of the Son of Man sending angels to remove all things that offend and lawbreakers from His kingdom (like dross), leaving the righteous to shine. *Hebrews 12:27* mentions God removing what can be shaken (implying transient, worthless things) so that what cannot be shaken remains, akin to removing dross from creation. Thus, Psalm 119:119 fits into a larger biblical theme that God’s refining judgments will eliminate the wicked (the impure elements) ultimately, which comforts the godly and leads them to love and obey God’s Word even more fervently.

## Psalm 129 – Imprecation on Zion’s Haters: Wither Like Grass

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 129:5–6* — “**Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion**. **Let them be as the grass upon the housetops**, which **withereth afore it groweth up**.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** The psalmist prays that all who hate Zion (Jerusalem/God’s people) will be **utterly shamed and forced to retreat** in defeat. He wants every enemy of God’s people to fail and slink away confounded. He then gives a vivid simile: *“May they be like rooftop grass that withers before it can even grow.”* In ancient Israel, flat rooftops would gather a little soil where grass might sprout after rain, but with shallow soil and scorching sun, it dies quickly. So the prayer is that Zion’s haters will have extremely short-lived success – they spring up momentarily, but then **dry out and die** before amounting to anything.
* **Context:** Psalm 129 is one of the “Songs of Degrees” (or Ascents) that pilgrims sang on the way to Jerusalem. It reflects on Israel’s afflictions and God’s deliverances. Verses 1–4 recount how from youth (early history) Israel was oppressed by enemies (plowers plowed her back, etc.), but “the LORD is righteous” and cut those cords. Then verses 5–8 (the end) pronounce an imprecation on all who hate Zion – essentially all enemies of God’s chosen city/people. Our verses (5–6) form the initial wish: shame and futility for Zion’s haters, like rooftop grass. Verses 7–8 continue the image: such grass is so meager that reapers can’t fill their hands with it, and passers-by won’t say, “Bless you in the name of the LORD” (implying no one will consider them blessed by God). The context suggests these “haters of Zion” could be neighboring hostile nations or any who oppose God’s purposes for Jerusalem. The psalm likely has Babylon’s or other oppressors’ fate in mind – they had their moment but withered under God’s judgment. It’s both a curse and a statement of trust: God will ensure the long-term failure of those who fight against His people. So pilgrims singing this affirm that though enemies persist, their efforts will come to nothing. The rooftop grass metaphor reminds every generation that the mightiest anti-God forces are ultimately fragile and fleeting.
* **Cross References:** *2 Samuel 17:23* (Ahithophel’s end) isn’t directly referenced but an example: a hater of David’s Zion who ended in disgrace. More generally, *Psalm 35:4* (again) – “Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul,” similar language for enemies (here specifically “hate Zion”). *Isaiah 40:24* says of princes and judges who oppose God, “scarcely are they planted... He blows upon them and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away like stubble.” That’s very akin to “grass that withers before it grows.” *2 Kings 19:35* might be in view historically: the Assyrians encamped against Zion, boasting, but overnight 185,000 withered – truly short-lived invasion attempt (Isaiah 37:27 also likened nations to grass on housetops, scorched before growth). *Mark 4:5–6* even uses the image spiritually: seed on rocky soil springs up but withers for lack of root – a different application, but shows the known phenomenon of quick, shallow growth ending in withering. Finally, *Psalm 37:2* “they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb,” sums up the destiny of evildoers. So Psalm 129:5–6 is inline with many scriptures assuring that those who set themselves against God’s people or plan have ephemeral success at best. They cannot thrive long-term; God’s “Zion” will outlast all its haters.

## Psalm 137 – Vengeance upon Babylon the Destroyer

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 137:8–9* — “O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; **happy shall he be**, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. **Happy shall he be**, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.”
* **Plain Interpretation:** In this exilic psalm, the captives in Babylon vent a shocking imprecation: They address Babylon (personified as a “daughter”) doomed by God’s decree. They declare that the one who repays Babylon for its cruelty to the Judeans will be **blessed** or **happy**. In particular, they say that whoever seizes Babylon’s infants and **smashes them against the rocks** (just as Babylonian troops did to Judean babies during the conquest) will be counted fortunate and praiseworthy. This is essentially calling for **tit-for-tat** vengeance: Babylon violently slaughtered our children, so may someone do the same to theirs – and that avenger will be doing God’s justice and thus be “happy” (in the sense of satisfied or blessed for carrying out divine retribution). It’s brutal language reflecting the horrors experienced and the intense desire for God’s justice.
* **Context:** Psalm 137 is a mournful remembrance of the Babylonian exile. Verses 1–3 describe the Jews weeping by Babylon’s rivers, unable to sing Zion’s songs, and being taunted by their captors. Verses 4–6 express deep yearning for Jerusalem. Then verses 7–9 pivot to calling down judgment on their enemies. Verse 7 asks God to remember Edom’s treachery during Jerusalem’s fall (Edom cheered Babylon on). Then verse 8–9 (above) is directed at Babylon itself. “Who art to be destroyed” indicates they believed (rightly, per prophecy) that Babylon’s turn for destruction was coming (the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah had predicted Babylon’s downfall). The exiles pronounce a beatitude upon whoever becomes the instrument of Babylon’s punishment – which historically turned out to be the Medes/Persians under Cyrus, who indeed conquered Babylon (without recorded baby-smashing, but this is poetic justice language). The infants dashed reflects the real atrocities inflicted on Judah (see 2 Kings 8:12, Hosea 13:16 for similar acts by Assyrians). By saying the doer of the same to Babylon will be “happy,” they imply he’s carrying out just revenge (not that the act is pleasant, but that justice is finally being served measure for measure). This psalm doesn’t claim God sanctioned baby-killing, but rather vents human anguish and desire for God’s judgment to match Babylon’s crimes. Such rawness teaches how deeply oppression can scar the human soul and also that ultimately, God did repay Babylon (though Cyrus was more merciful historically – but the empire fell nonetheless). The last line stands as one of the Bible’s most disturbing imprecations, showing there is space in Scripture even for expressing the darkest desires for payback, though the New Testament guides believers to a higher path of leaving vengeance to God and seeking enemies’ good.
* **Cross References:** The sentiment “reward as you served us” parallels *Jeremiah 50:15* and *29*, where God says to Babylon: “it is the vengeance of the LORD; take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.” And *Jeremiah 51:56* “the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite.” Isaiah also foretold *Babylon’s fall (Isaiah 13:16)*: “Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.” This was predicted as part of Babylon’s punishment via the Medes. *Hosea 13:16* (re: Samaria) and *Nahum 3:10* (re: Thebes) mention similar atrocities in war – sadly common in antiquity. So Psalm 137:9 isn’t inventing cruelty; it mirrors real war crimes done to them. *Revelation 18:6* echoes the payback principle on “Babylon” (symbolic of a wicked world system): “Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works.” Though Revelation doesn’t mention infants, it calls for proportional judgment. Thus, Psalm 137 connects with a larger biblical motif of *lex talionis* on a national scale: empires that mercilessly butchered others reap what they sowed. The “happy” avenger may allude to Cyrus, whom Isaiah 44:28; 45:1 calls God’s shepherd/anointed to subdue Babylon (though Cyrus didn’t literally dash babies, he did overthrow Babylon). In summary, Psalm 137 is a cry that God’s promised vengeance would indeed come – and history showed it did, as Babylon fell and ceased to be a world power, never again to terrorize God’s people.

## Psalm 139 – “Surely Thou Wilt Slay the Wicked, O God”

* **KJV Verse:** *Psalm 139:19*\* — “**Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God**: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.” *(Verses 21–22 further state, “I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee… I count them mine enemies.”)*
* **Plain Interpretation:** After marveling at God’s omniscience and creation, David affirms confidently that God will **kill the wicked**. It’s as if he says, “O God, you will certainly put the wicked to death!” Therefore, he wants no association with violent, bloodthirsty people – he tells them, “Get away from me, you men of bloodshed.” In other words: trusting that God will judge and destroy evildoers, David rejects the company of those who rebel against God. He underscores this by declaring in v.21–22 that he hates those who hate God, viewing them as his own enemies because they are God’s enemies. It is an expression of loyalty: he’s on God’s side against the wicked.
* **Context:** Psalm 139 is famous for its meditation on God’s intimate knowledge (v.1–6 “Thou knowest my downsitting… such knowledge is too wonderful”), His inescapable presence (v.7–12 “whither shall I flee from thy presence?”), and His role as Creator in the womb (v.13–16 “I am fearfully and wonderfully made”). It extols God’s thoughts as precious (v.17–18). Then abruptly in v.19, David turns to zeal against the wicked. It’s like after contemplating God’s holiness and purposes, David contrasts those who oppose this God. He insists that God, who sees all and made all, will surely **deal with the wicked** by slaying them. “Depart from me, bloody men” suggests perhaps David is reflecting on actual enemies (like cruel foes in his life) and in the context of God’s omnipresence, he wants separation from those God opposes. Verses 20–22 clarify he means people who blaspheme and rebel against God. His “hatred” is not petty malice but a complete moral repulsion and opposition (the next verse 23–24 shows he still asks God to search his heart, lest his hatred be tainted by sin). So, he aligns himself fully with God’s cause: those who shed innocent blood and speak against God are the ones God will slay, and David wants nothing to do with them – indeed he declares it a righteous hatred. It reflects the covenant ideal: “the fear of the LORD is to hate evil” (Proverbs 8:13). Thus, Psalm 139:19 is part of a bold declaration of allegiance – David cannot sing of God’s wonderful works and then be neutral about those who defy God’s authority. He looks forward to God removing them (slaying) and in the meantime, he personally distances (and even opposes) them.
* **Cross References:** David’s command “depart from me” to evildoers echoes *Psalm 6:8*, “Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.” Jesus also uses that phrase eschatologically in *Luke 13:27*, telling wicked rejecters, “Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity,” tying to final judgment – which parallels “surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God.” The sentiment “I hate them that hate Thee” finds parallel in *2 Chronicles 19:2*, where a prophet asks Jehoshaphat, “Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore wrath is upon thee.” It implies God’s approval when we side against His enemies rather than befriending them. Conversely, *James 4:4* says friendship with the world (God-hating system) is enmity with God. *Exodus 20:5* mentions God showing mercy to thousands who love Him, but visiting iniquity on those who hate Him (implying their doom is sure). In terms of slaying the wicked, many verses like *Psalm 68:21* (God wounds the head of His enemies) or *Isaiah 11:4* (Messiah will slay the wicked with His breath) reaffirm that destiny. So, David’s “Surely you will slay the wicked” is consistent with faith that God’s justice will prevail. It’s bold to say out loud, but for David, that’s part of adoring the Holy God – acknowledging that holiness means ultimately eliminating evil. His hatred is not personal vendetta but siding with God’s righteous judgment. The New Testament tempers personal hatred but upholds hating sin and evil (Romans 12:9 “abhor that which is evil”). David’s prayer to search him after these strong claims (v.23–24) shows he still submits his zeal to God’s examination, an example for us when feeling righteous anger.
