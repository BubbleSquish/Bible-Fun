# Christian Kabbalah: A Beginner’s Guide

Christian Kabbalah is a mystical approach that reinterprets Jewish Kabbalah symbols through the life and teachings of Jesus.  Historically it arose in the Renaissance, when thinkers like Giovanni Pico della Mirandola saw in Kabbalistic ideas a way to deepen Christian faith.  In Christian Kabbalah, Hebrew letters, divine names, and the ten Sefirot (attributes of God) are studied not for occult power but as spiritual symbols pointing to Christ.  This is **not** the same as practicing Jewish Kabbalah; instead, it uses Kabbalistic imagery to enhance Christian devotion.  (Jewish Kabbalists note that non-Jewish “Cabala” freely reassigns meanings and even adds magical elements foreign to Judaism.)  Christian Cabala (sometimes spelled “Cabala” to distinguish it) explicitly reframes Kabbalah “through a Christian lens”.  For example, Pico promoted Kabbalah as “one of the movements…to prove the truth of Christianity”, even famously writing that “no science…assures us more of the divinity of Christ than…Kabbalah”.

## Daily Devotional Practices

Begin each day with traditional Christian prayer **enhanced by Kabbalistic meditation**.  For instance:

* **Morning Prayer and Scripture:**  Pray a short liturgy or Psalm (e.g. **Psalm 145** or **John 1:1–5**), then meditate on a Hebrew divine name in that text.  You might, for example, slowly breathe out the letters **Y‑H‑W‑H** (the Tetragrammaton for God) or **Y‑eshua‑Shua** (Jesus’ name in Hebrew, יֵשׁוּעַ‎).  Contemplate each letter’s meaning (e.g. Yod = God’s “point” of presence, Hey = His breath of life) as you pray in the morning light.  (In Jewish tradition, prayer three times daily is the norm; you can similarly fix morning, midday, and evening devotion times.)

* **Scripture Reflection:**  Read a brief passage and reflect allegorically.  For example, **Psalm 119** is an alphabetic acrostic (each of its sections begins with successive Hebrew letters).  You can meditate on Psalm 119 one letter at a time, connecting each stanza to Christ (e.g. seeing God’s Law as foreshadowing Jesus’ teachings).  Or take New Testament verses (like **John 3:16** or **1 Corinthians 13:13**) and look for hidden depths in the original Hebrew or Greek that relate to Kabbalistic concepts.  Christian Kabbalists often read Scripture on multiple levels (literal, allegorical, etc.), finding spiritual meanings in even mundane words.

* **Evening Reflection and Prayer:**  At day’s end, review the day’s blessings and struggles through a Kabbalistic lens.  You might use the **Shema (Deut. 6:4)** or **Jesus’ Prayer (“Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me”**) while visualizing the *Tree of Life* (see diagram below) and sensing God’s presence (the Shekhinah).  Conclude with a short prayer of gratitude, perhaps repeating a divine name or short Psalm (e.g. **Psalm 121** “I lift up my eyes…”).

Throughout these devotions, integrate Christian mystical tradition: use hymns like *“O Comforter”* (invoking the Spirit) or *“Jesus, Thou Joy of Loving Hearts”* to center your heart on Christ.  Many Christian mystics (St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross) stressed prayerful attention to God’s presence, which complements the contemplative Kabbalah approach.

## Meditative Exercises: Hebrew Letters and Divine Names

Christian Kabbalah often employs **imaginative meditation on Hebrew letters and names of God** as prayer tools.  For beginners, simple exercises include:

* **Visualization of Letters:** Pick a Hebrew letter (for example, **י Yod**, the smallest letter). Sit quietly, draw it on paper or imagine it glowing, and repeat it silently.  Think of its pictogram (Yod is like an arm/hand) and how God uses His “hand” in creation.  Breathe slowly and say a related divine name: e.g. meditate on **Y‑H‑W‑H**, taking each breath with one letter.  The medieval *Sefer Yetzirah* teaches that God created the world by combining Hebrew letters, so meditating on letters is a way of touching creation’s source.  One source observes that Kabbalists “imagin\[ing] Hebrew letters and focus\[ing] on Divine Names” is a path to union with God.  In a Christian version, you might see **Yod** as symbolizing Christ (the “hand of God” in John 5:27) or **Shin** (ש) as the Spirit’s breath.

* **Name Recitation:** Slowly chant or say aloud one of God’s Hebrew names or titles.  For example, pray the Tetragrammaton **יהוה (YHWH)**, or **אדוני (Adonai)**.  After each recitation, pause and listen inwardly.  You can combine this with a breath: inhale saying “Adon…” and exhale “…ai.”  As you do, feel the meaning of “Lord” or “Jehovah” in your heart.  Similarly, use the name **יהושע (Yeshua)** for Jesus.  Spell it out: Yod (הand of God), Waw (nail/bridge), Shin (fire/spirit), Ayin (eye/vision).  Meditating on **Jesus’ Hebrew name** links the person of Jesus to the divine name, making your devotion both biblical and mystical.

* **Letter Combinations:** Try forming *tzeruf* (letter combinations).  For example, combine letters of **YHWH** with **Aleph (א)** to form **יהוה + א = אהיָה‎ (Ehyeh)**, meaning “I Am” (cf. Ex. 3:14).  Contemplate how “I Am” is fulfilled in Christ (John 8:58).  Use simple gematria (numeric) meditations if helpful: e.g. the word **חי‎ (Chai, life)** has the same value as **Yeshua** (ישׁוּעַ = 391); reflect on Jesus as the source of life.  (Remember: these are devotional tools, not magic spells.)

In all these exercises, maintain a **Christ-centered intention**.  Kneel or sit reverently, pray the Holy Spirit’s guidance, and always relate the mystical symbol back to Jesus’ example.  As you meditate on a letter or name, you might punctuate with a verse like *“Before Abraham was, I Am”* (John 8:58) or *“Jesus Christ: the same yesterday, today, and forever”* (Heb. 13:8) to keep Christ at the center.

## The Tree of Life and the Ten Sefirot

&#x20;*The Kabbalistic **Tree of Life**, showing the ten Sefirot (divine emanations). In Christian Kabbalah each Sefirah is seen as a Christological symbol.*

Christian Kabbalah reinterprets the ten Sefirot as facets of God made known in Christ.  For example:

* **Keter (Crown):** God’s hidden will or supreme divinity (the Father beyond all).
* **Chokhmah (Wisdom):** God’s wisdom.  In Christian terms this often represents Christ as the **Logos** (John 1:1) – divine Wisdom incarnate.
* **Binah (Understanding):** God’s understanding or insight.  Christians may associate this with the Holy Spirit, who grants spiritual insight into Christ.
* **Chesed (Lovingkindness):** God’s unconditional love and grace.  This is perfectly shown in Jesus’ compassion and sacrifice (e.g. *“God is love”* – 1 Jn 4:8).  describes Chesed as “the Grace of God and unconditional love.”
* **Gevurah (Strength/Judgment):** God’s power and justice.  In Christ we also see God’s righteous authority (e.g. His teaching on divine judgment).  Gevurah “balances” Chesed, reflecting how Christ embodies both mercy and truth.
* **Tiferet (Beauty/Compassion):** The balance of mercy and justice.  Christian Kabbalists explicitly identify **Tiferet with Christ**.  As one source notes, *“In Christian Kabbalah, Tiphereth is the Christ, the Word made flesh: the perfect man between Heaven and Earth”*.  In other words, Jesus is the center of harmony.
* **Yesod (Foundation):** The foundation of reality.  This can symbolize Christ as the foundation of the Church (e.g. 1 Cor 3:11), or the union of divine and human (Yesod is a meeting point of upper and lower Sefirot).
* **Malkuth (Kingdom):** God’s Kingdom manifest on earth.  In Christian terms this is Christ’s kingship and the reign of God inaugurated in the Church and world (cf. Rev 21:1–7, where the Tree of Life reappears).  Malkuth is also called the Shekhinah (Divine Presence); Christian Kabbalists may see the Holy Spirit filling creation here.

Each Sefirah thus becomes a meditation on Christ’s revelation. *(Note: Traditional Jewish Kabbalah has its own meanings for the Sefirot; Christian Cabala repurposes or renames some attributes. The goal here is to honor Christ in every divine attribute, not to appropriate Jewish religious practice.)*

## Biblical Passages and Mystical Meanings

Christian Kabbalists read Scripture **mystically**, seeing Christ hidden in both Old and New Testaments.  For example:

* **Genesis (Creation):** Kabbalah teaches God created with ten “utterances” (the Sefirot).  Christians see the Trinity active in creation (“God said…”) and point to John 1:1 (“In the beginning was the Word \[Logos]…and the Word became flesh”).  You might meditate on each day of creation as a step toward the Incarnation.
* **The Name of God:** In Exodus 3:14–15 God calls Himself “I AM” (Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh) and YHWH.  Kabbalists meditate on each letter of these names.  Christians hear in “I AM” a foreshadow of Jesus’ “I am” statements (e.g. *“Before Abraham was, I AM”* – John 8:58).
* **Psalms:** Many psalms are quoted in the Gospels.  **Psalm 22** (“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”) is famously cried by Jesus on the cross.  One can meditate on its Hebrew verses as prophetic echoes of Christ’s Passion.  Likewise, **Psalm 119** (an acrostic on the Hebrew alphabet) invites reflection on God’s law through every letter – an exercise in seeing the Logos in Scripture.
* **Song of Songs:** Medieval Christian Kabbalists, like many Church Fathers, saw this as an allegory of Christ (the Bridegroom) and the Church (the Bride).  You can read its romantic imagery spiritually: each Hebrew verse reflects divine love.  (Pico even commissioned a Latin translation of Levi ben Gershon’s Kabbalistic commentary on Song of Songs to explore these themes.)
* **Prophets and Wisdom:** Prophecies of the Messiah (Isaiah 53, Daniel 7:13–14) can be read alongside Kabbalistic themes (for instance, Daniel’s “one like a son of man” may remind one of the ideal Kabbalistic man, Adam Kadmon).  Proverbs 8 personifies Wisdom – Christians hear Christ speaking there (*“The LORD possessed me as the beginning of His way…”*).
* **New Testament:** The Book of Revelation explicitly draws on Kabbalistic symbols (the seven churches, the lamb, the New Jerusalem with twelve gates for the twelve tribes).  You can pray through Revelation as a modern “Zohar” of Christ’s cosmic reign.

In practice, **choose a verse or passage and look for Hebrew patterns** (acrostics, wordplay) or symbolic numbers.  For example, Exodus 14:19–21 contains a 72-letter text from which the 72 Names of God (Shem ha-Mephorash) are derived.  While full mastery of these formulas isn’t needed, even noticing that a name of God appears repeatedly in a passage can be the seed of meditation.  Let your imagination pray over the text: *How does this speak of Jesus?* – an approach very much in line with *aleturgical* or *anagogical* interpretation used by Renaissance mystics.

## Jewish vs. Christian Kabbalah

It’s important to be clear: **Jewish Kabbalah** is an esoteric stream within Judaism (focused on the Torah and often studied only by devout Jews). **Christian Kabbalah** is a later, outside reinterpretation of Kabbalah’s imagery.  Jewish sources explicitly warn that some Christian Cabala “freely adapted” Kabbalistic texts into magical and Gnostic schemes – practices that Jewish law would forbid.  In other words, orthodox Judaism does *not* recognize Christian Kabbalah as part of its faith.

Christian practitioners must therefore be sensitive and respectful.  When we speak of Sefirot, we are using the Kabbalistic *language of symbols*, not claiming its original religious context.  We should always bow in humility to the God of Israel (who also became incarnate as Jesus) and avoid any hint of using names or symbols for “magic.”  As one modern description notes, Christian Cabala is essentially a **Christianized form of Kabbalah** that “reimagines it through an entirely Christian lens,” rather than a faithful practice of Judaism.  In short: **borrow the symbolism, but remain true to Christ’s Gospel.**

## Beginner’s Exercises (Step-by-Step)

Here are simple guided steps to begin.  You can adapt the following exercises as daily practices.

1. **Letter Meditation Example (e.g. on **י**, Yod):**

   * Sit quietly and breathe. Begin with a short prayer: *“Lord Jesus, I focus my heart on You.”*
   * Visualize the Hebrew letter **י** before your eyes. Draw it on paper or imagine it glowing.
   * Contemplate its meaning: Yod is literally a “point” – mediate on the idea of the small point of God’s presence.  Think of Scripture like *“By the word of the LORD the heavens were made”* (Psalm 33:6) as God’s creative point.
   * Slowly repeat the divine name **יהוה** (YHWH) or **יֵשׁוּעַ** (Yeshua) in your mind, one letter at a time, breathing with each letter.  Feel God’s grace (Chesed) entering you.
   * Read a verse aloud (e.g. John 8:58 *“Before Abraham was, I AM”*).  Note the “I AM” echoes the *Ehyeh* of Exodus.  Let this connection deepen your sense of Christ’s divinity.
   * Close with thanksgiving, e.g. “Blessed are You, Lord, King of the universe.”

2. **Tree of Life Visualization:**

   * Gently draw or imagine the *Tree of Life* diagram (see above).  Picture its 10 Sefirot arranged in three columns.
   * Begin at **Keter (Crown)** above your head: in prayer or silence, invite the Father’s will into you (“Father, let Your will be done”).
   * Mentally descend through **Chokhmah (Christ’s wisdom)** and **Binah (Spirit’s understanding)**: acknowledge Christ and the Spirit.  For example, reflect on **John 1:14** as you “stand” at Tiferet (center).
   * At **Tiferet (Beauty)** – Christ’s place – silently affirm *“Jesus, You are here.”*  Feel His compassion bridging the upper and lower worlds.
   * Continue down through **Chesed, Gevurah, Yesod** (recalling His love, strength, foundation of our faith).  At **Malkuth (Kingdom)** (around your feet), pray “Thy Kingdom come” and see the world (earth, all creation) bathed in Christ’s light.
   * Conclude by imagining a small light (the Shekhinah) filling you and then the room.  End with the Lord’s Prayer or a simple *“Jesus, I trust in You.”*

3. **Name-Focused Prayer:**

   * Choose one of God’s Hebrew names or titles each day (e.g. **El Shaddai – God Almighty**, **Adonai – Lord**, **Elohim – Creator**, or **Yeshua**).
   * Write it down and look at it.  Say the name softly, then meditate on the biblical meaning or image behind it.  For example, *El Shaddai* (“God of the Mountain/Breast”) suggests God’s sustenance – recall how Jesus fed the 5,000 or call on Mary as Mother of Christ during this meditation.
   * Pair the name with a Scripture: “Blessed be **El Shaddai**, the God of Abraham” (Gen 49:25) and then *“I am the bread of life”* (John 6:35).  Seek Christ’s presence in that name.
   * Spend 5–10 minutes in this focused prayer, then journal any insights or words that come to you (as many mystics did).

4. **Daily Cycle:** Incorporate brief Kabbalistic reflection into regular Christian devotions.  For example, while praying *“Glory be to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit”*, imagine each Person filling one Pillar of the Tree. Or as you walk (Hitbodedut-style), count steps: on 1–3 invoke YHVH, on 4–6 invoke Yeshua, on 7–9 invoke Ruach (Spirit), uniting them at 10 as Keter.

Always keep the exercise **simple and reverent**.  These methods are tools to draw your mind deeper into Christ.  They are not ends in themselves.  Over time you will develop a rhythm – for instance, **Letter Meditation** as part of your morning devotion, the **Tree visualization** at noon or evening, and the **Name prayer** anytime you need comfort.

**Remember:** All Christian Kabbalistic practice is meant to lead you to Jesus.  Approach it with humility, trust in the Holy Spirit, and faith that **“the words I say to you are spirit and life”** (John 6:63).  In this way, the mystical *Tree of Life* and all the Hebrew symbolism become, at heart, a path to union with Christ.

**Sources:** This guide draws on historical Christian Kabbalistic tradition and Scripture interpretations. These reveal how Hebrew letters, names, and the Sefirot have been and can be prayerfully integrated into a Christ-centered devotional life.
