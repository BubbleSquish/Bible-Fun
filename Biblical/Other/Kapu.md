Each entry below expands on these themes:

## Breaking Kapu (General)

Ancient Hawaiian society was governed by *kānawai* (sacred laws or *kapu*).  As the National Park Service records at Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau, *“Any breaking of kapu disturbed the stability of society, and the punishment was often death.”*. In other words, kapu were divine taboos meant to protect social and spiritual order, and violating them endangered the community.  **Full passage:** “Certain people, places, things, and times were sacred – they were kapu… Any breaking of kapu disturbed the stability of society, and the punishment was often death”.

**Meaning:** This warning underlines that every kapu (from fishing limits and gender rules to prostration before royalty) was considered sacred. To break a kapu, even unintentionally, threatened *mana* (spiritual power) and was treated as a capital offense. Enforcement was strict: traditional accounts say trespassers on sacred ground or kapu violators were commonly killed by konohiki (land stewards) or *kāhuna* (priests) on the spot.

**Context/Recipient:** This applied universally under the pre-1819 kapu system – commoners and chiefs alike. For example, if a fisherman ignored a kapu on a fishery or a commoner ate prohibited food, they risked execution. The broader context was that kapu embodied respect for gods (Lono, Kāne, etc.) and ancestors; the warning emphasizes that all Hawaiians were expected to know and obey these sacred rules.

**Related Myths:** Many origin legends underscore this severity. For instance, the story of the god Kū and goddess Lono (in the *Kumulipo* creation chant) illustrates the power of kapu by showing gods punishing humanity’s misdeeds with death and chaos.  Likewise, in the legend of the demigod Māui, defying heaven’s rules incurs wrath. These narratives reinforce that kapu are life-or-death divine mandates.

## Fishing Kapu (Aku & ʻOpelu Fish)

Traditional lore records that certain fish were *kapu* (forbidden) during spawning to conserve resources.  As noted in collections of Hawaiian fishing tales: *“This kapu protected these fish from overfishing… insur\[ing] their survival; breaking the kapu could result in death.”*.  Specifically, *aku* (skipjack tuna) and *ʻopelu* were placed under kapu by the high priest Paʻao to honor his gods. **Quote:** “Both fish were sacred to the descendants of Paʻao… The kapu protected these fish from overfishing and from being killed during their spawning seasons… breaking the kapu could result in death.”.

**Meaning:** The warning signifies that harvesting *aku* or *ʻopelu* outside of their kapu seasons was not mere bad luck but a religious violation punishable by death. It instilled sustainable fishing practices: when kūpuna told fishermen *“don’t fish here, it’s kapu”*, they were invoking divine sanction. Fishing during a kapu period was seen as stealing the gift of the gods and thus incurring lethal consequences.

**Context/Recipient:** This targeted ancient Hawaiians who depended on the sea. ʻAhupuaʻa (land/sea divisions) were managed by *konohiki* (resource stewards) guided by *kāhuna*. The kapu on *aku* and *ʻopelu* specifically applied to fishers during spawning months (roughly February–July).  It was enforced by priests; anyone who violated it risked execution, unless they could make it to a *puʻuhonua* (place of refuge) to atone.

**Related Tales:** The story of Paʻao and Lonopele (a founding priest and his sacred fish) is directly connected. In that legend (recorded in Pukui’s folk-tales), the gods Lono and Kāne saved Paʻao at sea, and in gratitude Paʻao declared *aku* and *ʻopelu* kapu. Many Hawaiian folktales emphasize that transgressing these fishing prohibitions (e.g. taking the fish before the kapu is lifted) brought supernatural retribution or famine – a clear ancestral lesson about respect for nature.

## ʻAi Kapu (Food Taboos)

One of the strictest kapu laws was *‘Ai Kapu*, governing men’s and women’s meals.  Traditional accounts state: *“The ʻAi kapu… men and women could not eat meals together.  Furthermore, certain foods such as pork… most types of bananas… and coconuts were considered kapu to women.”*. In other words, these foods embodied gods (Lono’s pork, Kanaloa’s banana, Kū’s coconut), so women were forbidden to consume or even handle them.

**Meaning:** This warning taught Hawaiians that dining practices had divine significance. Breaking the ʻAi kapu (for example, a woman eating pork or a couple eating together) was thought to desecrate the gods’ forms and could invoke divine punishment. Underlying this teaching was a belief that cosmic order required gendered separation; sharing food between sexes or eating a god’s body form out of turn disrupted that sacred order.

**Context/Recipient:** The rule applied to all Hawaiians. Common people learned these taboos from childhood (and violators faced death or exile), while chiefs and priests derived special power from the system. The kapu was lifted only for specific royals – e.g. when King Kamehameha II abolished the system in 1819, he flagrantly ate with women, defying the ʻAi kapu. But before that, any husband/wife or parent/child caught eating together, or any woman eating the forbidden foods, risked the worst fate.

**Related Traditions:** Many stories allude to this practice. For example, lament chants for dead chiefs sometimes mention how “the two tables” of men and women were kept apart.  The eventual breaking of the ʻAi kapu by Kamehameha II (the famous *‘Ai Noa* event) is itself a major historical legend, illustrating how deeply ingrained the kapu was: even a king knew he could “not long rule” if he ate with women, until he had a queen of higher rank perform the act to make it sacred.

## Nightmarchers (Huakaʻi pō)

Hawaiian lore warns about the *huakaʻi pō*, the ghostly “night march” of ancient warriors. The tradition states that these ancestral spirits emerge on certain sacred nights and will kill any living person who looks at them.  **Exact warning:** “Ancient Hawaiian beliefs state that any mortal looking upon or being seen in defiance toward the marchers will die violently.”. The lore adds that a proper way to survive is to lie motionless, face-down, to show respect and fear, in which case the warriors may spare you.

**Meaning:** The warning teaches people to show deference to war gods and ancestors. The nightmarchers are led by a deified chief or king, accompanied by torches and war drums. The belief is that mortal eyes are not allowed to witness this royal procession. Defying it (e.g. by standing up or watching) would violate tapu and result in instant death or being carried off to the spirit world.

**Context/Recipient:** Anyone who lives or travels along ancient royal paths (often near heiau or former battlefields) during nights sacred to the gods Kane, Kū, Lono, or Kanaloa might encounter them. To prevent harm, families traditionally plant ti shrubs around homes – *“planting living ti shrubs…will cause the huakaʻi pō to avoid the area.”*. Parents and elders tell these tales to children as a caution (“if you hear drums, stay indoors”) so everyone knows not to venture out at those times.

**Related Lore:** Many ghost-stories (*moʻolelo ‘obake*) recount nights when someone illegally walked near a heiau or at Pali lookout and was saved only by dropping to the ground. For example, a BYU educational site notes that witnesses hear conch-shell blasts and marchers’ chants. This enduring myth parallels other cultures’ spirit-processions, but in Hawaiʻi it specifically reinforces respect for aliʻi (royalty) and their sacred aura. Modern guides still advise tourists: hide or lie down if you see torches or hear drums at night – a living echo of this ancient warning.

## Pele in Disguise (Hitchhiker)

Many Hawaiian legends describe Pele, goddess of volcanoes, appearing as a humble old woman.  A classic warning is: *“More than one person who has inhospitably refused food or lodging to some unprepossessing old woman has been mighty sorry for it afterward.”*. In one folkloric episode, a Japanese driver gave a ride to an old Hawaiian lady; later, the woman vanished and he was told she must have been Pele.

**Meaning:** The moral is to be respectful and generous to strangers, as they might be deities in disguise. In Pele’s case, she often tests travelers’ kindness. Refusing to help her (even when she seems lowly) invites her wrath – folklore says she will “be mighty sorry” (plague misfortune) the one who denies her. The deeper meaning is that humans should honor the gods’ humility; Pele’s true nature as both beautiful and terrible means she expects reverence.

**Context/Recipient:** These teachings target anyone traveling near volcanic areas (like the roads on Hawaiʻi Island to Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park). For example, before reaching Kilauea, people might be warned: *“if you see a lone old woman asking for a ride or alms, help her, for she could be Pele.”* Travelers told this ensure they show aloha even to the least attractive strangers. Traditional storytellers recount such encounters to emphasize that visitors must respect Pele’s *mana* and never underestimate anyone they meet.

**Related Narratives:** This motif is widespread. The Pacific Studies journal recounts multiple 20th-century episodes (an old crone hitchhiker whose assistance or denial affected passing cars). It parallels other world myths (e.g. Athena’s tests of hospitality in Greek lore). In Hawaiian myth, Pele’s younger sister Hiʻiaka also teaches kindness to strangers (as she rescues her lover), reinforcing the idea that the gods observe human kindness and cruelty alike.

## Pele’s Curse (Lava Rock Removal)

A well-known modern caution is that removing volcanic rock or sand from Hawaiʻi brings misfortune – popularly called *Pele’s Curse*.  One version of the warning states: *“Anything natively Hawaiian, such as sand, rock, or pumice, will bring bad luck on whoever takes it away from Hawaii.”*.  According to tradition, Pele will curse those who steal pieces of her sacred land.

**Meaning:** This teaching has become a widely told taboo. Its core is that disrespecting Pele’s sacred domain (by taking physical souvenirs like lava or sand) angers her. The curse (bad luck, accidents, illness) supposedly afflicts the thief until the item is returned. Whether originally an old Hawaiian belief or a 20th-century caution, it functions to remind people that Hawaiʻi’s natural features are not mere commodities, but part of Pele’s *kapu* world.

**Context/Recipient:** This warning is often directed at tourists and newcomers. Park rangers and residents tell visitors: “Don’t pocket that lava rock – Pele will get you!” Indeed, a Wikipedia summary notes the legend likely began when an exasperated ranger fabricated the curse to stop souvenir hunters. Even so, many locals honor the warning: each year they receive returned rocks in the mail from tourists seeking to lift Pele’s curse. The broader context is respect for the land and gods: the story serves as a modern kapu, discouraging people from vandalizing sacred landscapes.

**Related Beliefs:** Ancient kapu did forbid defiling sacred sites or objects. For example, chants about Mokuaweoweo (Kilauea’s summit) describe Pele’s displeasure with disrespect. While old literature (like Forbes’s *Legends of Hawaiʻi*) tells of Pele cursing specific individuals who angered her (e.g. by violating her rules), the rock-stealing curse is largely a recent twist. Nevertheless, it echoes traditional Hawaiian reverence for Pele and the rule: “take nothing, leave nothing, and show aloha for the land.”

## Kaupe (Nuʻuanu Dog-Man)

Hawaiian folklore recounts Kaupe, a fearsome dog-man spirit.  One traditional warning is: *“On those nights, wise travelers avoid crossing through Nuʻuanu to avoid the malicious ʻōlohe dog-man who roams the valley.”*. The story says that each month an eerie mist in Nuʻuanu Valley forms the shape of a giant white dog (Kaupe), and that any living person encountered then is in grave danger.

**Meaning:** The cautionary lesson is to heed old supernatural warnings about the landscape. Kaupe’s legend personifies the unknown dangers of wilderness paths at night. By teaching people to avoid Nuʻuanu on certain nights, it kept families safe. More broadly, it enforces respect for the land’s mana: Kaupe is sometimes seen as the remnant of ancient rulers or gods (the word *‘ōlohe* implies “body of a dog” spirit). Encountering him was believed to be fatal or to cause possession.

**Context/Recipient:** The immediate recipients are travelers on Oʻahu’s Nuʻuanu road (especially after dark). Kūpuna (elders) in the area would warn that Kaupe “once ruled Nuʻuanu” and still haunts its trails. The tale served as a practical admonition: avoid the remote valley at night. Today, the legend remains in place names and petroglyphs (ancient dog carvings along the route were said to warn Kaupe’s approach).

**Related Tales:** Kaupe belongs to a class of supernatural dog-people (*ʻōlohe*) in Hawaiian myth. A parallel story involves Kūʻilioloa, a benevolent dog-like kūpua (demi-god) who protected travelers on Oʻahu. Kaupe’s narrative is contrasted with such guardians; it reminds people that not all powerful spirits are friendly. It’s akin to other cultural warnings (e.g. not walking at night in haunted areas) but uniquely tied to Hawaiian imagery of ancestral spirits in animal form.

## ʻAumakua Shark Guardians

In Hawaiian belief, each family might have an *ʻaumakua* (ancestral guardian) that appears in nature, often as an animal.  Herb Kawainui Kāne explains a key warning: *“…the killing or eating of any shark was an act of filial disrespect, for which the ʻaumakua might punish them by bringing sickness upon the transgressors.”*. In other words, if a family’s ancestor spirit inhabited a shark, anyone in that family who harms sharks incurs illness as divine punishment.

**Meaning:** The lesson is to treat such animals with reverence. Sharks (especially species like the revered *māʻukeʻo* or *hāʻukeʻo*) were often family gods for coastal chiefs. This caution teaches that nature is sacred and that the community’s well-being depends on honoring one’s lineage. Sickness is the natural consequence (rather than arbitrary bad luck) of violating a taboo involving an ʻaumakua. Thus, the warning enforces respect for ancestral spirits manifest in animals.

**Context/Recipient:** This applied to particular kin groups who believed in shark ʻaumakua. For those Hawaiians, it meant they must refrain entirely from killing or eating sharks. In practice, it extended to anyone entering these family waters: fishermen would avoid spear-fishing sharks and treated shark sightings as omens or messages. The cautionary nature is both personal (do not betray your family spirit) and communal (respect nature’s balance).

**Related Myths:** The shark-god Kamohoaliʻi, brother of Pele, is a famous kūpua who saved sailors, highlighting sharks as positive ancestral figures. Other moʻolelo (legends) tell of maidens rescued by sharks or chiefs guided by shark ʻaumakua. These stories parallel the warning: honoring sharks brings blessings (good catch, safety at sea), while harming them invites curses. The shark-ʻaumakua taboo thus embodies a common Hawaiian theme: the gods protect those who revere them and punish those who do not.

**Sources:** All summaries above are drawn from traditional Hawaiian lore and cultural studies. Quotations and details are cited from Hawaiian folklore collections, historical accounts, and cultural historians, which document these cautionary teachings. Each reflects a warning embedded in myth, kapu (taboo), or spiritual belief.
