# Warnings in Hindu Traditions (Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, Smartism)

## Vaishnavism

| **Warning Topic**      | **Verse (Ref.)**               | **Summary Meaning**                                                                               | **Context/Recipient**                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sensual Pleasures**  | *Bhagavad Gita* 18.38          | Worldly pleasures seem sweet at first but end in suffering.                                       | Krishna’s counsel to Arjuna                       |
| **Attachment→Desire**  | *Bhagavad Gita* 2.62 (2.62–63) | Focusing on sense objects breeds attachment, which leads to lust and then anger.                  | Krishna’s summary of spiritual pitfalls to Arjuna |
| **Slay Lust (Desire)** | *Bhagavad Gita* 3.43           | Lust (kāma) is a powerful enemy; it must be controlled (even “killed”) by higher self-knowledge.  | Krishna urging Arjuna to conquer inner enemies    |
| **Duty Without Worry** | *Bhagavad Gita* 2.47           | One should perform one’s duty without attachment to results (“do the work, renounce the fruits”). | Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield              |

Below the table we expand each warning:

* *“That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is of the nature of passion.”* In other words, the Bhagavad Gita warns that all bodily pleasures (sexual, material) are temporary (“rajasic” – passionate) and eventually produce distress. Krishna tells Arjuna on the battlefield that **fleeting delights of the senses lead to pain**, paralleling Jesus’ caution against earthly treasures (cf. Mt 6:19–21). The context is Arjuna’s war‐field despondency, and Krishna is urging him to see beyond ephemeral gratifications.

* *“While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.”* This summary verse (BG 2.62) explains a causal chain: fixating on pleasures gives attachment (saṅga), which produces desire (kāma), which in turn breeds anger (krodha). This is essentially **a warning against indulgence in sensual fantasy**, echoing Christ’s warnings that unchecked lust and anger lead to sin (e.g. “If you are angry…” Mt 5:22, or “Everyone who looks lustfully…”, Mt 5:28). In context, Krishna is describing to Arjuna how uncontrolled mind and senses trap us in samsara.

* *“Thus knowing the soul to be superior to the material intellect, O mighty‑armed Arjun, subdue the lower self by the higher self, and **kill this formidable enemy called lust**.”* In Bhagavad Gita 3.43 Krishna explicitly orders Arjuna (addressed as “Mahā‑bāho”) to **“kill the enemy”** of kāma (desire). This hyperbolic warning (“kill lust”) parallels Jesus’ radical metaphor (“if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off” – Mt 5:30). It stresses that only by controlling desire through self‐knowledge (the higher Self) can one break free from bondage. The setting is Krishna advising Arjuna on yoga and self‑mastery.

* *“You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results, and never be attached to inaction.”* In BG 2.47, Krishna warns Arjuna **not to worry about outcomes** of his duty. This is a caution against anxiety and ego (“do not treat action’s results as your own doing”). It echoes Jesus’ teaching not to be anxious about tomorrow (Mt 6:34) and to trust in divine providence. Krishna’s context: Arjuna is reluctant to fight; Krishna reminds him that he must act according to dharma without fear or desire for reward.

## Shaivism

| **Warning Topic**           | **Verse (Ref.)**            | **Summary Meaning**                                                                                                    | **Context/Recipient**                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Self‐Knowledge (Moksha)** | *Shvetāśvatara Up.* 6.12–13 | Realizing the one Supreme within oneself brings eternal bliss; true knowledge (Yoga/Vedanta) frees one from all bonds. | Shiva Upanishad teaching (to a yogi) |

Expansion:

* *“There is a non‑dual Ruler of the actionless many; He makes the one seed manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise who perceive Him within themselves – and not to others.”* This Shvetāśvatara Upanishad verse (6.12) warns that **only those who realize the one Brahman within attain lasting bliss**. It implicitly warns us not to be distracted by pluralistic appearances. The next verse adds: *“He is eternal among eternals… He who has known Him by knowledge and yoga is freed from all fetters.”* Together, Shiva’s Upanishad teaches that ignorance of the Self binds us in sorrow, while the knower of the Lord (Śiva) within transcends suffering. In context, these are instruc­tions given to the student by Śiva (the emphasis on Yoga and knowledge is typical of Shaivism/Advaita). In Christian parallel, Jesus said, *“you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free”* (Jn 8:32); here the Hindu warning is **to seek self-knowledge or remain in bondage**.

## Shaktism

| **Warning Topic**               | **Verse (Ref.)**  | **Summary Meaning**                                                                                                                   | **Context/Recipient**                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Illusion of Māyā (Universe)** | *Devi Gītā* 3.1–4 | The Goddess creates the world through Māyā (illusion), but in truth that world does not really exist – only the Supreme Reality does. | Devi (Shakti) instructing King Dhruva |

Expansion:

* *“I imagine into being the whole world… through the power of my **Māyā**. Yet that same Māyā is separate from me; this is the highest truth. In reality… Maya does not exist – only the Supreme exists in an absolute sense.”*  In this excerpt from the Devī Gītā (a Shakta scripture), the Goddess warns that **the entire cosmos is a product of her illusion (Māyā)**. She emphasizes that worldly phenomena are ultimately unreal. The teaching is a clear caution against identifying with the “dream” of the world. (In context, Śakti explains creation to the king Dhruva.) A Christian analogy might be Jesus’ teaching that God’s kingdom is “within” (Lk 17:21) and that one must transcend mere material reality. Here the warning is **not to be deceived by the illusory world**: one should turn inward toward the Divine Mother.

## Smartism (Advaita Vedānta)

| **Warning Topic**              | **Verse (Ref.)**    | **Summary Meaning**                                                                                                                            | **Context/Recipient**                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Hollow Ritualism**           | *Mundaka Up.* 1.2.7 | “Frail indeed are those rafts of sacrifices… Fools who rejoice in them as the Highest Good fall victims again and again to old age and death.” | Sage Angiras to seekers (Upanishad teaching) |
| **Ignorant Pride (Blindness)** | *Mundaka Up.* 1.2.8 | “Living in the abyss of ignorance, yet wise in their own conceit, the deluded go round and round, like the blind led by the blind.”            | Sage Angiras to seekers (Upanishad teaching) |

Expansion:

* *“Frail indeed are those rafts of sacrifices… Fools who rejoice in them as the Highest Good fall victims again and again to old age and death.”* In Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.7 (advaita scriptures), the rishi Angiras warns that **mere ritualistic religion (without true knowledge) is like a flimsy raft**. Relying on external sacrifices and rites will not save one; the “fool” who trusts them falls repeatedly into Samsāra (rebirth and death). This cautions us – much like Jesus cautioned against empty religious formalism – that rituals alone do not lead to liberation. The context is Upanishadic instruction to earnest spiritual seekers to look beyond outward rites.

* *“Living in the abyss of ignorance, yet wise in their own conceit, the deluded go round and round, like the blind led by the blind.”* Mundaka 1.2.8 continues the admonition: those who are *actually ignorant* but imagine themselves wise are compared to blind leaders. This is a clear warning: **prideful ignorance is a trap**. (Saint Peter made a similar analogy: “if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit” – Mt 15:14.) In context, the sage is telling disciples that self‑deception and arrogance perpetuate suffering. Only humility and true knowledge free one from this “blindness.”
