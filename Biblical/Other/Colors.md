# White

* **Meaning:** Light, resurrection, purity, victory.
* **When used (most common):**

  * **Pascha (Easter) & Bright Week → Ascension:** priestly vestments, altar covers, processional gear.
  * **Great Feasts of the Lord:** Theophany, Transfiguration, often **Nativity**.
  * **Baptisms** (new life); often **weddings**.
  * **Funerals (Greek practice):** white to confess the **Resurrection**.
* **Notes:** In Byzantine practice, **white and gold** function as the same “bright” category. If you’re unsure, white/gold is the safe, correct default outside penitential seasons.

# Black

* **Meaning:** Mourning, strict penitence, sobriety, “death to the world.”
* **When used (mainly Slavic custom):**

  * **Great Lent (weekdays)** and **Great & Holy Friday**: dark sets—sometimes true black.
  * **Funerals & Memorials (panikhida)** in many Slavic parishes.
* **Monastic/Clergy clothing:** Everyday **black cassocks, mantles, klobuks** = repentance and renunciation. That’s **garb**, not a strict liturgical “color.”
* **Greek practice:** Often avoids true black for services; favors **dark purple/dark hues** instead.

* **Black (or very dark)** = penance, mourning—Lent weekdays, Holy Friday, Slavic funerals/memorials.
* **Local bishop/parish custom rules.** If your typikon says otherwise, you follow it.
