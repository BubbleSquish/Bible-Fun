Below we expand each warning, quoting the full saying and explaining its meaning, context, and Buddhist parallels.

### False Prophets / False Teachers

***“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.”***
Jesus uttered this warning during the *Sermon on the Mount*, addressing the crowd that included His disciples.  He cautioned his followers to be on guard against deceitful teachers who *appear* righteous but are actually dangerous. In other words, outward holiness is no guarantee of true virtue.

**Meaning:**  Jesus’ message is a clear admonition to use discernment.  It implies that not all who claim divine inspiration are genuine.  The context is a general teaching that the community should examine teachers by their fruits (see Mt 7:16–20).

**Buddhist parallel:**  The Buddha likewise urged careful scrutiny of teachers.  For example, in the **Kalama Sutta** (Theravada Pali Canon, *Anguttara Nikaya* 3.65), he famously tells the Kalama villagers: *“Do not go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture… by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’  When you know for yourselves… that these qualities lead to harm & to suffering – then you should abandon them.”*.  In other words, one should not accept doctrine merely on others’ authority, but test it against wise qualities.  Buddhist commentaries similarly warn against “parappavāda” (false doctrine) or “pariyavādas” (terroristic views).  While Buddhism does not speak of “prophets,” it repeatedly warns monks and lay followers to beware of unvirtuous teachers and to seek the Dharma in sincerity.  (For instance, the Pali Vinaya warns monks that causing schism in the order is gravely sinful, underscoring the importance of unity and truth among the Sangha.)

### The Narrow Gate / Few Are Saved

***“Enter through the narrow gate.  For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.  But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.”***
This teaching comes at the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:13–14).  Jesus contrasts two paths: the easy, popular way leading to ruin, and the difficult, narrow way leading to eternal life.  He solemnly warns that most people – the many – unwittingly choose the broad, destructive path, while only a few commit to the hard path of discipleship.

**Meaning:**  Jesus is exhorting his followers to rigorous faith and moral integrity.  The **context** is a general audience (crowd/disciple mix) hearing Him outline the ethos of the Kingdom.  The emphasis is on personal commitment: the right path is demanding and not easily followed.

**Buddhist parallel:**  Buddhism also teaches that the truly “good” rebirth is rare, and ignorance is common.  In *Theravada* scripture one finds the striking analogy: *“Just as there are few pleasant parks and lakes, but many dense thickets and inaccessible mountains, so are there few beings who will be reborn among men.  More numerous are those who will be reborn in purgatory.”* (Anguttara Nikaya 1.19).  In other words, few beings attain the human state (in which liberation is possible) while many fall into lower realms of suffering.  Likewise, Mahayana texts (e.g. the **Lotus Sutra**) emphasize the rarity and difficulty of attaining Buddhahood.  The Buddha’s “narrow path” is often interpreted as the Middle Way, free from extremes.  Both traditions thus underscore that liberation requires effort and is not the mass choice.

### Losing Life to Save It (Self-Denial)

***“Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.”***
Jesus spoke this to His disciples (cf. Mark 8:35/Matthew 10:39) as part of His instructions on discipleship.  He means that clinging selfishly to one’s earthly life (or personal ambitions) ultimately forfeits true life, whereas willing self-sacrifice or radical trust in Him secures eternal life.

**Meaning:**  On one level this is a paradox: denying worldly safety/gain leads to gaining one’s soul.  In context, Jesus is warning would-be followers that true discipleship involves suffering and self-denial (taking up one’s cross).  It flips conventional values: *exchanging self-interest for devotion*.

**Buddhist parallel:**  The Buddha likewise taught the importance of non-attachment to ego.  The *Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta* (Majjhima Nikaya 72) says, **“With the relinquishing of all thought and egotism, the enlightened one is liberated through not clinging.”** (MN 72.15).  In other words, abandoning self-centered clinging brings liberation.  Both Jesus and the Buddha emphasize that holding on (to life, ego, wealth, status) actually binds one to suffering, whereas relinquishment brings freedom.  (In Vajrayana, too, disciples are warned that “non-attachment” is the path to awakening.)

### Peace – Do Not Be Afraid

***“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.  Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”***
This comforting warning comes from Jesus at the Last Supper (John 14:27), spoken privately to His disciples.  He promises a special peace from Him and repeatedly tells them: do not let anxiety or fear overwhelm your hearts, even as He must soon suffer.

**Meaning:**  Jesus addresses natural fears (of betrayal, death, future).  He tells followers to trust in God’s care (through Him).  The context is intimate (Jesus is departing soon), and the encouragement is to inner calm and faith, despite external troubles.

**Buddhist parallel:**  Buddhism likewise extols fearlessness (*abhaya*) as a virtue.  For instance, in the *Panchatara Sutta* (Majjhima Nikaya 6) the Buddha affirms *“May fear and dread not conquer me”*, meaning he himself remains untroubled by fear.  Throughout the Pali Canon, the wise remain mindful and undisturbed.  (In Vajrayana tradition, fearlessness is one of the “Ten Powers” of a Buddha.)  Thus both traditions encourage peace of mind over anxious trembling.

### Blasphemy and Schism (Grave Sin)

***“Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.”*** (Mark 3:29)
Jesus warned the Pharisees that attributing the work of the Spirit to evil was unforgivable.  This severe warning (often paraphrased as the “unpardonable sin”) is given in the context of confrontations with religious authorities.

**Meaning:**  The exact nature of this warning is debated, but broadly it signifies that some sins are so contrary to God’s truth that they sever one’s connection to forgiveness.  The context was the Pharisees accusing Jesus of casting out demons by Satan – Jesus replies that refusing the Spirit’s power is ultimate wickedness.

**Buddhist parallel:**  Buddhism does not have the same concept of blasphemy, but it **does** treat the unity of the Dharma community as sacred.  The Pali Vinaya explicitly warns monks: *“Any monk who causes a schism in the once undivided Sangha will, after death, be boiled in hell for a thousand ages.”* (Vinaya Cullavagga 7.3.16).  In effect, dividing the community or undermining its purity is a gravely sinful act.  This is analogous to Jesus’ harshest warnings: both traditions treat certain violations of the Dharma/Spirit as especially heinous.

### Pure in Heart (True Vision)

***“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”***
This Beatitude from the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:8) promises that those who are inwardly sincere and morally undivided will perceive the divine.  It was spoken to the general crowd of followers, highlighting inner purity over outward show.

**Meaning:**  True spiritual vision comes through a clean heart – one free of deceit, malice, and inner conflict.  In context, it follows other Beatitudes emphasizing attitudes (poverty of spirit, meekness, mercy, etc.), culminating in purity of motive and empathy.

**Buddhist parallel:**  The Buddha similarly associates *seeing God* (or Brahma) with inner purity, especially compassion.  As one parallel text puts it: *“Anyone who withdraws into meditation on compassion can see Brahma with his own eyes, talk to him face to face and consult with him.”* (Dīgha Nikāya 19.43).  Here “seeing Brahma” is akin to realizing the highest reality through purity of heart (compassion).  Thus both traditions link pure motivation and loving meditation with ultimate spiritual insight.

### (Additional Notes on Traditions)

* **Theravāda parallels:**  Most parallels above come from early Buddhist texts (Pāli Canon), e.g. *Kalama Sutta* (AN 3.65), *Majjhima Nikāya*, *Dīgha Nikāya*, *Vinaya*.  These highlight the Buddha’s practical warnings (e.g. against blind faith, attachment, fear, schism).

* **Mahāyāna parallels:**  Mahayana sutras emphasize similar themes (the difficulty of liberation, the power of compassion).  For example, the *Lotus Sūtra* and *Vimalakīrti Sūtra* stress right intention and warn against false teachings, and the concept of *Madhyamā-pratipad* (Middle Way) echoes the “narrow path” idea.

* **Vajrayāna parallels:**  Tantric texts (Kangyur) often stress fearlessness (*vīrya*, *jīvanmukti*), non-attachment, and secrecy (avoiding schism).  While no Vajrayana scripture names Jesus, the universal Buddhist themes of the Bodhisattva ideal can be seen as complementary to many of Jesus’ warnings (e.g. altruistic sacrifice, compassion, ethical integrity).  In Tibetan Buddhism, the emphasis on *samaya* (vows) likewise mirrors the seriousness of Jesus’ warnings about faithfulness.

In all cases, the entries above show that *discipline of mind and moral vigilance* are central in both Jesus’ teachings and Buddhist doctrine.  Each warning has its counterpart: Christian calls to sincere faith and right conduct find echoes in Buddhist admonitions to verify truths, act compassionately, and remain undisturbed by delusion. These parallels across traditions underscore a shared emphasis on inner purity, selflessness, and awakening.
