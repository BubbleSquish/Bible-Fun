# Heresy, Apostasy, and Blasphemy — Core Christian Definitions

## What Does *Heretic* Mean in Christianity?

A **heretic** is not just someone with a different opinion. In Christianity, it means a person who **claims to follow Christ** yet **denies or twists the core truths of the faith**.

---

### 1. Root of the Word
- From Greek *hairesis* — “choice” or “sect.”  
- Originally meant “faction” in the early Church.  

**Galatians 5:20 (KJV):**  
*“Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies.”*  

**1 Corinthians 11:19 (KJV):**  
*“For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.”*  

---

### 2. Biblical Usage
**Titus 3:10 (KJV):**  
*“A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject.”*  

**2 Peter 2:1 (KJV):**  
*“But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.”*  

**1 John 2:22 (KJV):**  
*“Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.”*  

**1 John 4:3 (KJV):**  
*“And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.”*  

**Heresy = deliberate, persistent opposition to revealed truth.**

### 3. Early Church Response
- Treated heresy as **spiritual rebellion** that endangers salvation.  
- Examples:  
  - **Arianism** — denied Christ’s divinity.  
  - **Gnosticism** — denied Christ’s humanity.  
  - **Pelagianism** — denied original sin and grace.  
- Councils like **Nicaea (325 AD)** condemned heresies to guard doctrine.

### 4. Practical Meaning
- A heretic **claims Christ** but **refuses His truth**.  
- Seen as **soul-damaging** since it leads others astray.  
- Distinction: not a mistake, but **rebellion against truth**.

## Heretic vs. Apostate vs. Blasphemer

These three words are often confused, but they mean different things in Christian teaching:

---

### 1. Heretic
- **Definition**: Claims to be Christian but **denies or distorts essential teachings**.  
- **Focus**: Wrong belief.  
- **Example**: Arius — taught Jesus was created, not eternal God.  
- **Scripture**:  

**1 Corinthians 11:19 (KJV):**  
*“For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.”*  

**Titus 3:10 (KJV):**  
*“A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject.”*  

Corrupts doctrine **inside the faith**.  

---

### 2. Apostate
- **Definition**: **Abandons the faith** after once professing it.  
- **Focus**: Falling away.  
- **Example**: Judas Iscariot; Hebrews 6:6’s warning.  
- **Scripture**:  

**1 Timothy 4:1 (KJV):**  
*“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.”*  

**Hebrews 6:6 (KJV):**  
*“If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.”*  

Walks **out of the faith** completely.  

---

### 3. Blasphemer
- **Definition**: **Speaks irreverently** against God, Christ, or the Holy Spirit.  
- **Focus**: Wrong speech.  
- **Example**: Pharisees accusing Jesus of using Satan’s power.  
- **Scripture**:  

**Matthew 12:24 (KJV):**  
*“But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.”*  

**Mark 3:29 (KJV):**  
*“But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.”*  
 **Insults or mocks God**, in or outside Christianity.
