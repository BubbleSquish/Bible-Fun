## Scope and Method

* **Thematic parallels, not doctrinal identity.** Parallels map ethical warnings and spiritual cautions, not theology of salvation or Christology.
* **Canonical anchors.** Gospel passages are from the canonical Gospels; Islamic references are from the Qur’an and widely‑reported hadith.
* **Economy of quotation.** Summaries paraphrase the sense. Readers should consult full texts for wording and context.

---

## 1. False prophets and deceivers

**Jesus:** Mt 7:15–20; Mt 24:4–5, 11, 23–25. Warns of wolves in sheep’s clothing and messianic impostors; tests are by fruits and fidelity to truth.

**Islamic parallels:** Qur’an condemns inventing lies against God and leading from His path (6:93; 7:45) and warns against worldly deception (31:33). Eschatology includes Dajjāl and multiple impostors in hadith.

**Takeaway:** Discern claims by outcomes and conformity to revelation.

---

## 2. Hypocrisy and showmanship in worship

**Jesus:** Mt 6:1–6, 16–18; Mt 23. Warns against public righteousness to be seen; pronounces woes on hypocrites.

**Islamic parallels:** Condemns ostentation and heedless prayer (107:4–7), spending to be seen (4:38), invalidated charity by reminders/injury (2:264), and outlines signs of nifāq (63:1–4).

**Takeaway:** Seek sincerity before God, not praise before people.

---

## 3. Greed, hoarding, and love of wealth

**Jesus:** Lk 12:15–21; Mt 6:19–24; Mt 19:23–24. Warns that life is not possessions; treasures in heaven; wealth can enslave.

**Islamic parallels:** Blame of rivalry in accumulation (102) and hoarding (104); warning on hoarding gold/silver (9:34–35; 3:180); censure of neglecting orphans and poor (89:17–20).

**Takeaway:** Wealth is a test; attachment corrodes.

---

## 4. Neglect of the poor and vulnerable

**Jesus:** Mt 25:31–46; Lk 16:19–31. Judgment scenes center on mercy to the hungry, stranger, sick; parable of the rich man and Lazarus.

**Islamic parallels:** Denunciation of those who repel the orphan and withhold small kindnesses (107); blame for not encouraging feeding the poor (69:33–34); call to the steep path of freeing and feeding (90:12–18); praise for feeding solely for God’s face (76:8–9).

**Takeaway:** Neglect of the weak invites judgment.

---

## 5. Unforgiveness and hard hearts

**Jesus:** Mt 6:14–15; Mt 18:21–35. Forgiveness received must be extended; refusal imperils one’s standing.

**Islamic parallels:** Enjoin forgiveness and magnanimity (24:22; 3:134). God’s vast forgiveness is offered (39:53). Prophetic teaching censures mercilessness.

**Takeaway:** Mercy received obligates mercy given.

---

## 6. Lust and adultery

**Jesus:** Mt 5:27–30. Condemns lustful intent and calls for radical moral discipline.

**Islamic parallels:** Forbids approaching zina (17:32); prescribes legal penalties (24:2) and commands modesty and lowering the gaze (24:30–31).

**Takeaway:** Guard the heart and the gaze.

---

## 7. Anger and contempt

**Jesus:** Mt 5:21–22. Condemns murderous anger and demeaning speech; reconciliation is urgent.

**Islamic parallels:** Praises those who restrain anger and pardon people (3:134). Prophetic counsel prioritizes anger‑control.

**Takeaway:** Unchecked anger endangers the soul and community.

---

## 8. Oaths and truthfulness

**Jesus:** Mt 5:33–37. Let your “Yes” be yes; avoid manipulative oath‑craft.

**Islamic parallels:** Do not use oaths to hinder good (2:224); expiation for broken oaths (5:89); rebuke of saying what one does not do (61:2–3).

**Takeaway:** Simple, reliable speech signals integrity.

---

## 9. Causing others to stumble, misguiding

**Jesus:** Mt 18:6–9. Severe warning for causing “little ones” to stumble; radical avoidance of scandal.

**Islamic parallels:** Condemns blocking God’s path (7:45) and harming believers (33:58).

**Takeaway:** Responsibility scales with influence; avoid scandals and misguidance.

---

## 10. Love of status and pride

**Jesus:** Lk 14:7–11; Mt 23:5–12. Exalts humility; condemns love of titles and places of honor.

**Islamic parallels:** Forbids arrogance and haughtiness (31:18; 16:23); parable of Qārūn’s hubris (28:76–83); reminds that man transgresses when he deems himself self‑sufficient (96:6–7).

**Takeaway:** Seek the low place; God raises the humble.

---

## 11. Worry and worldly anxiety

**Jesus:** Mt 6:25–34. Rejects anxious striving; prioritize God’s kingdom.

**Islamic parallels:** Worldly life as play and adornment (57:20); do not lose heart (3:139); whoever relies on God, He suffices (65:3).

**Takeaway:** Trust displaces corrosive anxiety.

---

## 12. Trusting in wealth not God

**Jesus:** Mt 6:24; Mk 10:17–31. You cannot serve God and Mammon; riches can hinder discipleship.

**Islamic parallels:** Man’s intense love of wealth (100:6–11); warning to the miser and denier (92:8–11).

**Takeaway:** Wealth makes a poor master.

---

## 13. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit and shirk

**Jesus:** Mt 12:31–32; Mk 3:28–30. Warning against attributing God’s work to evil.

**Islamic parallels:** Shirk—associating partners with God—is the unforgivable sin if unrepented (4:48; 4:116).

**Takeaway:** Guard the heart’s allegiance and attribution of the sacred.

---

## 14. Judgment without self‑examination

**Jesus:** Mt 7:1–5; Lk 6:37–42. Measure you use will be measured to you; remove your beam first.

**Islamic parallels:** Forbids mockery, suspicion, backbiting (49:11–12); rebukes preaching righteousness while neglecting oneself (2:44).

**Takeaway:** Reform self before correcting others.

---

## 15. End‑times deception and complacency

**Jesus:** Mt 24:4–13, 36–51; Lk 21:34–36. Warns of deception, tribulation, and the need for vigilance.

**Islamic parallels:** Cautions against worldly deception (31:33) and speaks of eschatological upheavals (18:99; 21:96). Hadith warn of Dajjāl and urge vigilance.

**Takeaway:** Stay awake; anchor in revealed truth.

---

## 16. Fruitlessness and empty profession

**Jesus:** Mt 7:21–23; Jn 15:1–6. Mere confession without obedience fails; fruitlessness is judged.

**Islamic parallels:** Rebuke for saying without doing (61:2–3); salvation linked to faith and righteous deeds (103:1–3); call to command right and forbid wrong (3:104).

**Takeaway:** Orthodoxy must flower into orthopraxy.

---

## 17. Hidden sin and hypocrisy

**Jesus:** Lk 12:1–3. Nothing hidden will not be revealed.

**Islamic parallels:** God knows the most hidden secrets (86:9; 3:29; 64:4).

**Takeaway:** Live as if everything will be disclosed—because it will.

---

## 18. Persecution, denial, and shame

**Jesus:** Mk 8:34–38; Mt 10:32–33; Jn 15:18–21. Discipleship entails cross‑bearing; denying before men has consequences.

**Islamic parallels:** Trials test believers (29:2–3; 3:142; 2:155); concession for compulsion with the heart firm (16:106).

**Takeaway:** Expect tests; seek steadfastness without public faithlessness.

---

## 19. Divorce and hardness of heart

**Jesus:** Mt 19:3–9; Mk 10:2–12. Return to creation ideal; hardness of heart permitted concessions but does not justify injustice.

**Islamic parallels:** Regulates divorce with justice and due process (2:231–232; 65:1–2) and forbids harm.

**Takeaway:** Protect marriage with justice; if parting, part rightly.

---

## 20. Regarding children and “the least”

**Jesus:** Mt 18:1–5, 10; 19:14. Receive the kingdom like a child; do not despise little ones; welcome them is to welcome Him.

**Islamic parallels:** Command to safeguard orphans (4:2); do not oppress the orphan or repulse the beggar (93:9–10); justice toward children and the vulnerable (6:152); kindness to parents (17:23–24).

**Takeaway:** Honor the small and dependent; God defends them.

## Usage

* **For study groups:** Use the table to assign themes. Read both Gospel and Qur’an passages. Compare ethical thrust, not theology.
* **For teaching:** Pair each section with primary‑text reading and a short case study.
* **For personal audit:** Pick one theme per week, journal practical steps.

## Cautions

* Parallels are **ethical** not **creedal**. Do not flatten real doctrinal differences.
* Hadith numbering varies; consult critical editions or reliable databases.

## Further Reading

* Synoptic Woes: Matthew 23; parallels in Mark/Luke.
* Qur’anic themes: *takāthur* (102), *nifāq* (63), *riya’* (107), stewardship and justice.
