## 1) The Enemy Exposed

Jesus identifies the enemy as a liar from the start and the father of lies, a murderer who hates the light (John 8:44; John 3:19–20). Scripture names him the deceiver and accuser (Revelation 12:9–10). When truth shows up, his works get exposed, so he counters with counterfeit power, signs, and **lying wonders** aimed at those who refuse the love of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:9–10).

## 2) Why Purity Is Attacked

Purity undermines his grip because it originates in God: “the wisdom from above is first **pure**” (James 3:17), and the pure in heart **see God** (Matthew 5:8). He therefore moves with subtlety—corrupting minds from the **simplicity** in Christ (2 Corinthians 11:3) and disguising himself **as an angel of light** (2 Corinthians 11:14). He targets pure worship (John 4:24), holy living (1 Thessalonians 4:3–7), and single-hearted devotion, baiting with the **lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the pride of life** (1 John 2:16).

## 3) Stand Your Ground

Orders of the day: **be sober, be vigilant** (1 Peter 5:8). **Submit to God; resist the devil** and he will **flee** (James 4:7). **Armor up** to stand against the schemes of the devil (Ephesians 6:11–13). Guard your heart (Proverbs 4:23), set your mind on what is **pure** (Philippians 4:8), and keep yourself in hope and holiness (1 John 3:3). The Son of God appeared to **destroy the works of the devil** (1 John 3:8); you overcome **by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony** (Revelation 12:11).

## 4) Purity Defeats Satan

Purity is lethal to Satan because it reflects God’s holiness, which he cannot endure. The light of a pure heart exposes his lies and strips away his power, for he thrives only in darkness and corruption. Every act of sincerity, holiness, and devotion to God is like a weapon against him — a reminder of his defeat at the cross. In other words, signs of purity makes Satan angry and die.
