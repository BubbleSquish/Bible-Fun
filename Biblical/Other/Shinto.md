## Purification from Impurity and Sin (Harai)

&#x20;*Translation excerpt (Great Purification norito, Engishiki)*: “Offenses related to agriculture were regarded as abhorrent as those which caused ritual impurity… The gods punish Susanoo for his rampages by cutting off his beard and nails – an act of purification in which the sins and pollution adhering to him are removed, thus turning him from a destroyer of life into a giver of life.” In Shinto tradition, physical and spiritual defilement (罪 *tsumi* and 穢れ *kegare*) are treated as **“dirt” to be cleansed**. The *Ōharae no Kotoba* (Great Purification prayer) recited twice yearly enumerates various sins – from violence and injuring beings to breaking societal taboos – that accumulate uncleanness, bringing misfortune upon the people. Through confession and the **harai** purification rites, these evils are washed away and harmony with the kami is restored. The emphasis is not on guilt or eternal condemnation, but on **atonement and renewal**: by sincerely purging impurity, people can return to a state of purity and receive the blessings of the gods.

*Meaning:* This teaching warns that **impure or selfish conduct pollutes one’s spirit and community**, separating people from the divine protection. However, through repentance and purification, one can be made clean again. The Shinto view, as articulated by modern priests, is that human “error and uncleanness” are mistakes of immature souls, not irreversible stains – they can be expunged by proper rites and sincere effort. In essence, everyone is born with a divine spark of goodness; **the task is to continually cleanse impurities** (such as dishonesty, greed, or cruelty) that obscure that inner light. This echoes the idea that moral transgressions must be confronted and cleansed for a person to live a wholesome, blessed life.

*Context:* The Great Purification ritual (大祓 *Ōharai*) was traditionally performed at the imperial court and local shrines each June and December, **absolving “all the people under Heaven” of the offenses committed in the preceding half-year**. A high priest would recite the norito prayer listing sins and asking the heavenly gods to sweep away these impurities “as the wind blows apart the clouds” and “as perishable leaves are scattered”. The gathered community then passes through a large grass ring (*chinowa*) or partakes in symbolic acts (like rubbing paper dolls on oneself and casting them away) to transfer and remove their defilements. The intended recipients are **the entire populace** – from peasants to the emperor – emphasizing that **all people require purification and forgiveness**. No one is exempt from the need to humbly purify their “misdeeds, impurities, or bad luck” before entering a new season. This communal rite reinforces social harmony: by erasing accumulated sins such as quarrels, broken promises, or pollution of the land, the community renews itself in unity.

*Comparison to New Testament:* This emphasis on inner and outer purity finds a parallel in Jesus’s teaching: *“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”* Here Christ extols inward purification as the key to communion with the divine. Just as Shinto harai seeks to wash away impurities blocking people from the kami’s favor, Jesus calls for **repentance and a cleansed heart**, promising that the pure-hearted will experience God’s presence (Matthew 5:8). Moreover, the idea of regular repentance and renewal echoes the New Testament exhortation: *“Repent... that your sins may be blotted out”* (Acts 3:19). Both traditions stress that one must continually cast off moral defilements to live in grace and harmony.

## Consequences of Arrogance and Impurity (Susanoo’s Divine Punishment)

&#x20;*Excerpt from Kojiki/Nihon Shoki (Amaterasu and Susanoo myth)*: “Susanoo committed numerous abhorrent acts in the Plain of High Heaven: he **uprooted the rice paddies, flooded the ridges (double planting),** and even **skinned alive the Heavenly piebald horse** and flung it into the weaving hall. When the flayed horse’s hide fell, one of the weaving maidens was injured and died. For these rampages, the 8 million gods decreed punishment – Susanoo’s beard was cut and the nails of his hands and feet pulled out – and he was banished from Heaven.” This dramatic myth highlights a grave Shinto warning: **willful violence, sacrilege, and disruptive selfishness will not be tolerated by the divine**. Susanoo’s misdeeds – destroying food sources, desecrating sacred space with filth and blood, and causing the death of an innocent – are precisely the kinds of sins described as *amatsu tsumi* (“heavenly sins”) in the Great Purification prayer. His behavior shattered the harmony of Heaven and brought immense sorrow (even the Sun goddess Amaterasu hid in a cave out of grief and anger, plunging the world into darkness).

*Meaning:* The tale teaches that **arrogance and impure conduct carry dire consequences**. Susanoo, in his pride and rage, believed he could act recklessly – but he faced a humiliating comeuppance. The council of gods effectively “exiled” him and ritually purged his power, symbolized by shaving his beard (a sign of status) and removing his nails. Some interpretations note that stripping his nails was an act of exorcism or purification, indicating that **the only path forward for Susanoo was humble repentance and cleansing**. Indeed, after his banishment, Susanoo undergoes trials on earth that transform him: he slays the evil eight-headed serpent and becomes a culture hero, suggesting redemption is possible once pride is subdued. The implicit moral is twofold: (1) Those who **wilfully defy divine order or exploit others will be “brought low” by divine justice**, and (2) sincere atonement can restore one to favor. Shinto, therefore, cautions leaders and common people alike to **avoid haughty, destructive behavior** – upholding harmony (和 *wa*) and purity is paramount, lest calamity befall not only the sinner but the wider world (as seen when Amaterasu’s light was lost because of Susanoo’s sin).

*Context:* In the mythic chronology, Susanoo is the storm kami and brother of Amaterasu. The context of this episode is his visit to Heaven to bid farewell before exile. Although he claimed good intentions, his inner turmoil (anger and jealousy) manifested in outrageous acts. Amaterasu and the heavenly kami observed his *impure heart* through these deeds. The intended “recipient” of the gods’ harsh lesson was Susanoo himself – a deity being taught a very human lesson about hubris. But by extension, **this story was a cautionary teaching to early Japanese society**: even divine beings are subject to moral laws. The ruling elites who saw themselves as descendants of Amaterasu would have noted that **no one is above the consequences of cruel deeds**. When the myths were recorded in the 8th century, Japan’s court was establishing a legal code influenced by Chinese Confucian ideas; Susanoo’s tale reinforced in indigenous form that social order and ritual sanctity must be respected by all, under pain of divine retribution.

*Comparison to New Testament:* The theme strongly recalls Jesus’s teaching: *“For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.”* Susanoo “exalted himself” through impulsive, selfish actions and was literally abased – cast down from Heaven and shorn of dignity. This resonates with Christ’s warnings to the proud (Luke 14:11). Additionally, just as Susanoo’s eventual redemption came after punishment and remorse, the New Testament emphasizes that **God “chastens” those He loves, to yield the fruit of righteousness (Hebrews 12:6-11)**. Both traditions affirm that **prideful misconduct leads to downfall**, while humility and purification pave the way to restoration. Susanoo’s later heroism after repentance mirrors the biblical pattern of a sinner reformed (akin to the Prodigal Son who is humbled in exile before being welcomed back). In short, Shinto myth and Jesus’s teachings converge on this point: *do not defile the sacred or harm others in arrogance, lest you be cast out – instead, humble yourself to find favor again*.

## Compassion and Benevolence Rewarded (The Hare of Inaba)

&#x20;*Story excerpt (Kojiki, “White Hare of Inaba”)*: Ōkuninushi (called Ōnamuchi in this tale) was traveling with his eighty elder brothers, all of whom were suitors competing to marry Princess Yakami. Along the road, they encountered a poor hare lying naked and in agony – his fur had been ripped off by a shark after a failed trick. The brothers **mocked the hare and cruelly told it to bathe in salt water and dry in the wind**, which only worsened the creature’s pain. Later, Ōkuninushi came upon the hare, took pity, and gently said: *“Go to the river-mouth and wash in fresh water, then roll in the pollen of cattails. That will heal your skin.”* The hare followed his advice and was miraculously restored to a full, shiny coat. Revealing its divine nature, the Hare proclaimed to Ōkuninushi: *“You, who carried the baggage, shall be the one to obtain the princess.”* In the end, Princess Yakami rejects the arrogant older brothers and chooses Ōkuninushi, fulfilling the hare’s prophecy.

*Meaning:* This beloved legend carries a clear ethical teaching: **true kindness and empathy toward the vulnerable will be rewarded**, whereas callousness and envy lead to disgrace. Ōkuninushi’s elder brothers were selfish and **maliciously enjoyed the hare’s suffering**, giving bad advice out of spite. Their lack of compassion not only caused harm but also cost them the divine favor – they “certainly did not get the Princess of Yakami,” as the Hare deity foretold. Ōkuninushi, by contrast, demonstrates what Shinto later calls *magokoro* (sincere heart): he helps the hare with no thought of reward, motivated purely by sympathy for its pain. In doing so, he aligns with the will of the kami (the Hare was an emissary testing their hearts). The rewarding of Ōkuninushi illustrates the Shinto belief that **the gods bless those who act with *masurao* (gentle benevolence and courage)**. The story also has an undertone of *Divine justice*: the humble youngest brother, once burdened as a porter, is elevated above his haughty siblings – **a classic reversal of fortune to honor virtue over pride**. Japanese scholars interpret this struggle between kind Ōkuninushi and his wrathful brothers as symbolic of **“civilization vs. barbarism”**, suggesting that mercy and honesty are marks of a civilized (divinely approved) person, whereas cruelty is base and ungodly.

*Context:* In the narrative context, this episode is part of the mythic cycle of Ōkuninushi, a deity associated with nation-building and medicine. It serves as an **etiological tale (origin story)** explaining why Ōkuninushi won his bride and later became master of the land (eventually ceding the world to the Heavenly Grandson in exchange for his own shrine). The immediate setting is the province of Inaba, but culturally the story was told across generations to instill a lesson in children and adults alike. **The intended audience is essentially everyone** – it’s a folklore style tale, easy to remember and retell, teaching that *“the last shall be first”* if he is good-hearted. We see that Ōkuninushi, though born into a divine royal family, starts in an almost servile position (carrying luggage) due to his meek personality. The Hare of Inaba appears to test the brothers’ character. In Shinto, animals often act as messengers of the gods, and here the hare is explicitly called a deity after its healing. Thus, the context implies that everyday encounters with those in need (even a wounded animal or stranger) are opportunities to demonstrate virtue. The **Hare’s prophecy and the subsequent marriage** also reinforce the social message: rulers (or husbands) are chosen by Heaven based not on brash strength but on **compassionate merit**. This gentle ethos helped balance the warrior ethos in Japanese culture by valuing **mercy, healing, and kindness** as divine qualities.

*Comparison to New Testament:* The parallels to Jesus’s teachings are striking. Ōkuninushi’s behavior embodies *“love thy neighbor as thyself”* – he treated the hare’s wounds as tenderly as if they were his own. His brothers act like the priest and Levite in Jesus’s Parable of the Good Samaritan, who pass by a suffering man without helping. Ōkuninushi, like the Good Samaritan, stops and cares for the victim (Luke 10:30-37). **Jesus exalted such compassionate love**, commanding: *“So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.”* Ōkuninushi did exactly that for the hare, and in return “as he did, so it was done unto him” – he received blessing and honor. Furthermore, the reversal where the lowly brother is exalted echoes Jesus’s words, *“Whoever wants to be first must be servant of all”*. Just as Christ taught that **the meek and merciful are blessed (Matthew 5:5, 5:7)**, the Shinto narrative affirms that **meekness and kindness triumph over cruelty**. Both traditions make clear that **God (or the gods) vindicate the righteous who show mercy**, often in unexpected ways. The Hare of Inaba could well be seen as a mirror to the Gospel principle: *“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.”*

## Selfless Leadership and Charity (Emperor Nintoku’s Sage Rule)

&#x20;*Historical legend (Nihon Shoki, Emperor Nintoku)*: In the 4th year of Emperor Nintoku’s reign, he climbed a high tower and surveyed his realm. He was dismayed to see **no smoke rising** from the cooking fires of any home – a sign that the people were too impoverished to buy rice or firewood. Moved by compassion, Nintoku declared: *“For the next three years, let there be no taxes and no forced labor.”* All levies on the farmers were suspended. As a result, **his palace fell into disrepair** – “the thatch decayed and was not repaired; wind and rain leaked in and soaked the beddings; sunlight peeped through holes in the roof”. The Emperor and Empress wore old, worn clothing and endured hardship as the treasury received nothing. Nintoku told his complaining wife that **the people’s welfare came first**, famously saying *“the people’s poverty is my poverty.”* Three autumns passed. Nintoku again climbed the observation tower and this time **saw thick smoke rising from every home**, and the fields laden with grain. The people had grown prosperous and comfortable. Only then did he announce that taxes would resume (at a reasonable rate) – and the populace rejoiced, gladly paying and hailing him as *Nintoku the Sage Emperor*, praising his benevolent virtue.

*Meaning:* This episode is held up in Japanese lore as the pinnacle of **imperial benevolence (徳 *toku*)** and mirrors the ideal of a servant-leader. The moral teaching is that **a true leader prioritizes the well-being of his people over his own comfort or wealth**. Nintoku recognized that the ruler’s prosperity is meaningless if his subjects suffer; indeed, he equated his subjects’ poverty with his own. His **self-imposed sacrifice** demonstrates **charity, empathy, and just governance** – qualities that Shinto and Confucian-influenced thought lauded in an ideal sovereign. By foregoing revenue, he allowed the farmers to rebuild their livelihoods, which ultimately strengthened the entire nation. The tale implicitly warns against greedy or self-indulgent rulers: had Nintoku insisted on taxation despite the famine, both people and state would have collapsed. Instead, his patience and mercy led to greater prosperity for all, including the throne (once taxes resumed, the people paid “gladly” because they loved and respected him). The **praises of his virtue “filled the land”**, indicating a moral lesson: **personal virtue is the foundation of legitimate authority**. Nintoku’s reign is thus remembered as a golden age where **social harmony (和) was achieved through righteousness and selflessness** – an implicit encouragement for everyone to exercise generosity within their means. Even outside the ruling class, the story inspires the idea that **helping others at cost to yourself is honorable and will ultimately yield happiness and honor** (what later generations might call *giri-ninjo*, duty and human compassion in harmony).

*Context:* Emperor Nintoku is traditionally dated to the 4th century (though these accounts mix legend with possibly real events). The context in Nihon Shoki is that of an idealized sovereign setting a moral example. By the time of compilation (720 CE), the Japanese court was avidly absorbing Confucian ideals of benevolent kingship; Nintoku’s anecdote perfectly illustrates Confucian filial governance applied in a Shinto-grounded narrative. The intended audience was likely the ruling elite and officials as much as commoners – it was a template for how an Emperor (believed to be descended from the sun goddess) should reflect **the solar virtues of warmth, light, and nurturing** toward the people. However, the story was also popularized in textbooks and storytelling as Japan’s equivalent of a “saintly king” (akin to tales of Emperor Ashoka in Buddhism or King Alfred in England). Its longevity in the cultural memory suggests it served as a gentle reprimand to any leaders who might forget their duty: Nintoku endured a leaky roof so that thousands of his subjects could repair theirs – **would today’s leaders do the same?** The context underscores that Nintoku’s reward was not material but moral – the love of his people and a flourishing, peaceful domain. Thus, **the story is a guideline for all people in positions of power or privilege**: use your advantages to uplift others, not to enrich yourself.

*Comparison to New Testament:* Emperor Nintoku’s ethos aligns closely with Jesus’s teaching to his disciples on leadership: *“Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.”* In essence, Nintoku “became the servant” of his entire nation – he served their needs by relinquishing his rights to tax and by sharing their hardship. This servant-leadership is exactly what Christ modeled by washing his disciples’ feet and saying, *“The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve”*. The joy and loyalty of Nintoku’s people when prosperity returned calls to mind Proverbs 29:2: *“When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.”* In the Gospels, Jesus also teaches generosity to the poor: *“Sell what you have and give to the poor… and you will have treasure in heaven”* (Mark 10:21). Nintoku effectively gave away the ‘treasure’ of three years of revenue, storing up a different kind of treasure – **a harmonious society and a shining legacy**. Like the widow’s mite (Mark 12:41-44), the value of his sacrifice was measured not in coin but in **the love and well-being it produced**. Both Shinto and Christian perspectives here affirm: **self-sacrifice for the good of others is a supreme virtue that brings lasting reward**. Nintoku is a living parable of the Christ-like idea that *“greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends”* – or in this case, lay down his comfort and wealth for his people.

## Sincerity of Heart (Magokoro) and Virtue

&#x20;*Teaching from Shinto scholarship*: *“As the basic attitude toward life, Shintō emphasizes **makoto no kokoro** (‘heart of truth’), or **magokoro** (‘true heart’), usually translated as *sincerity, pure heart, uprightness*. This attitude follows from the revelation of the truthfulness of the kami in humans. It is the sincere attitude of people doing their best in their work or relationships with others, and the ultimate source of such an attitude lies in awareness of the divine… Although Shintō ethics do not ignore individual moral virtues (loyalty, piety, love, etc.), it is generally considered more important to seek magokoro, which is the dynamic life-attitude that brings forth these virtues. In ancient scriptures magokoro was interpreted as ‘bright and pure mind’ or ‘bright, pure, upright, and sincere mind.’ **Purification, both physical and spiritual, is stressed in order to produce such a state of mind**, necessary for communion between kami and humans and to receive the blessings of the kami.”*

In Shinto’s oldest stories and prayers, **sincerity of heart** emerges as a core ideal. This concept of *makoto* (真, truth) or *magokoro* speaks to an **integrity and purity of motive** that should underlie all actions. Rather than a list of thou-shalt-nots, Shinto’s divine cautions often urge a person to cultivate an honest, **unselfish mindset** – one that naturally guides them away from evil and towards good. For example, the three Imperial Regalia given to the first divine ruler (the mirror, sword, and jewel) are symbolically said to represent **wisdom (or truth), courage, and benevolence**. Of these, the mirror (truth) was accompanied by Amaterasu’s instruction to **“regard this mirror as my spirit; revere it as you would revere me”**. This can be seen as a teaching that **to reflect the divine, one’s heart must be as clear and sincere as a polished mirror**, without the distortion of deceit or ego. Many Shinto shrine prayers (norito) conclude with the petition that the participants may have a “bright, clean, straight heart.” In essence, **inner purity (honesty, good intent) is itself the path to all other virtues** – a sincere person will naturally be loyal, kind, and devout.

*Meaning:* Magokoro as a warning or exhortation means that **the real “sin” in Shinto is to act with a false or selfish heart**. Wrongdoing is viewed largely as arising from impurity or imbalance in the heart rather than from an inherent evil nature. Therefore, the remedy is to continually correct one’s heart through reflection (*misogi* and *harai* rituals aid this by calming anger, washing away grudges, etc.). A divine example appears in the Kojiki when the creator god Izanagi, after accidentally polluting himself in the underworld, performs ritual cleansing and is **mindful to “rectify” his spirit** – from that sincere purification the sun, moon, and wind gods are born, symbolizing that **clarity of heart gives rise to light and order**. In human affairs, **sincerity is stressed as the foundation of moral life**: an ancient proverb says *“the kami dwell in honest hearts.”* Conversely, someone who performs rites or outward good deeds but harbors malice or greed (*tatemae* differing from *honne*) is viewed as discordant with the Way of the Gods. Thus, Shinto teachings caution against **hypocrisy, avarice, and insincerity** – not through fire-and-brimstone sermons, but by extolling the beauty and efficacy of a pure heart. A person with magokoro will naturally avoid the major wrongs (violence, betrayal, egocentrism) because their conscience and the guiding kami won’t allow those to take root. In short, the **“divine caution” here is to guard one’s heart**: keep it true and clean, and all will be well.

*Context:* Unlike a single codified scripture, this teaching is woven throughout Shinto liturgy and mythology. Priests in shrine addresses often remind worshippers to **maintain a sincere heart in daily life** – for instance, when receiving a new amulet or during festivals, one is told that the amulet works as a focus for one’s own sincerity toward the kami. The Edo-period scholar Motoori Norinaga famously highlighted *makoto* (真) as the essence of Shinto, meaning a spontaneous, genuine feeling uncorrupted by rationalization or selfish calculation. In practical terms, **magokoro was directed to everyone**: farmers should plant and harvest with sincerity (not cutting corners or cursing their lot), artisans should craft truthfully (with pride and honesty in workmanship), family members should be sincere and faithful to each other, and leaders should govern with true intent for the public good. One concrete historical example is the **Oath of Emperor Meiji (1868)** which opened with “We shall seek knowledge throughout the world and thus **establish the foundations of the Imperial polity”**, but underlying it was the idea that **only through the sincere cooperation of all classes – samurai and commoner – could Japan thrive**. The **intended recipient of Shinto’s sincerity teaching is ultimately the individual’s conscience** – it’s a personal commitment as much as a social one. Unlike legalistic moral codes, Shinto places the onus on each person to continually purify and correct themselves from within. The role of the community and ritual is to support that inner work.

*Comparison to New Testament:* This focus on inner sincerity strongly echoes Jesus Christ’s emphasis on the **heart as the wellspring of righteousness**. Jesus taught that external ritual or pious appearances mean nothing if the heart is impure or hypocritical: *“This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me”* (Mark 7:6). He continually chastised the Pharisees for outward religiosity covering inner corruption, saying *“First cleanse the inside of the cup, that the outside also may be clean”* (Matthew 23:26). This is remarkably consonant with Shinto’s stress on *harai* – cleanse internally (one’s spirit) and outer goodness will follow. Jesus also proclaimed, *“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,”* linking the idea of inward purity (sincerity, free of duplicity) to the reward of experiencing the Divine. In Shinto, the person of magokoro “sees” (or at least feels) the kami more clearly and lives in harmony under heaven. Both traditions therefore warn that **the real battle between good and evil is fought in the human heart**. To Shinto as to Jesus, **a humble, honest heart is worth more than any external sacrifice**. As Jesus summarized the greatest commandment: *“Love the Lord your God with all your heart… and love your neighbor as yourself”* – essentially commanding full sincerity in devotion and human relations. Magokoro encapsulates just that: **whole-heartedness** in faith and conduct. In practice, a Shinto follower striving for magokoro will live out virtues that Christians would recognize as godly: truthfulness, reliability, gratitude, and kindness born from a “good treasure” of the heart (Luke 6:45). Thus, across time and cultures, we find a shared divine teaching: *Cultivate a pure and sincere heart, for therein lies the path to a virtuous life and communion with the Divine*.
