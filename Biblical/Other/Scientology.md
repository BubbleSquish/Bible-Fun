# Warnings and Cautions in L. Ron Hubbard’s *Scientology: A History of Man*

This document compiles all explicit **warnings, cautionary statements, and alerts** given by L. Ron Hubbard in *Scientology: A History of Man*. Each warning is listed with the original statement (quoted or paraphrased), an explanation of its meaning, the context or intended audience, and cross-references to related parts of the text or broader Scientology doctrine. The reference table below provides a quick overview of all the warnings, followed by detailed sections for each.

| **Warning Topic**                                      | **Brief Description**                                                                                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use an E-Meter for Safety**                          | Auditing whole-track incidents without an E-meter is unsafe for the preclear.                                |
| **Handling Restimulation While Studying**              | The book’s content can stir up one’s own incidents; handle it and continue unless it’s intolerable.          |
| **Avoid Running Incidents Literally**                  | Do not directly audit extremely heavy incidents (e.g. Facsimile One); use creative mock-ups instead.         |
| **Don’t Share “Whole Track” Incidents with Outsiders** | Telling untrained people about incidents (like the “clam”) can physically restimulate and harm them.         |
| **Caution Auditing Theta vs. MEST Body**               | Past-life theta incidents can physically shock a frail body (even risk death if mishandled).                 |
| **No Words in Early “Electronic” Incidents**           | Do not look for spoken words in ancient electronic implants – communication then was telepathic, not verbal. |
| **Facsimile One’s “Summons” Requires Care**            | Never run the “summons to court” part of Facsimile One until its emotional and pain charge is reduced.       |
| **Limits of Self-Auditing (No E-Meter)**               | Running incidents without a meter or guidance may improve the body but not the spirit (no tone rise).        |

## Use an E-Meter for Safety

**Original Warning:**

> “All incidents in this volume should be detected and audited with the assistance of an E-meter. If it were not for the E-meter these incidents would have remained undetected … Without an E-meter, they cannot be audited with security or even safety for the preclear.”

**Summary Explanation:** Hubbard emphasizes that an auditor must **use the Electropsychometer (E-meter)** when addressing the deep “whole track” incidents listed in this book. The E-meter’s readings are considered essential to **find and run these incidents safely**. Attempting to audit them **without** the E-meter is deemed highly **unsafe for the preclear**, because the auditor would be “flying blind” with no reliable indicator of the hidden traumas. In short, the E-meter guides the process and prevents the auditor from pushing the preclear into dangerous areas unawares; without it, there is no security or safety in tackling these powerful past incidents.

**Context / Intended Audience:** This caution appears in the introductory portion of *A History of Man* as Hubbard lays out how to use the incident list. It is **directed at Scientology auditors** (practitioners) about to apply the techniques in the book. At the time of writing (1952), the **E-meter was a new invention** in Dianetics/Scientology, and Hubbard is strongly underlining its necessity. The warning aims to prevent auditors trained on earlier, meter-less Dianetics methods from trying to run whole-track incidents on a preclear **without the proper instrument**, which could endanger the preclear’s mental or physical well-being.

**Cross-References:** In the book’s preface, Hubbard credits Volney Mathison’s invention of the **Electropsychometer** with making whole-track research and processing possible. This warning echoes that point: the **E-meter is presented as indispensable** for deep-track auditing. (Later in the book, Hubbard reiterates this principle, noting that if one audits incidents **without** a meter, the body may improve but **“the thetan never gets better”** – see **Limits of Self-Auditing** below.) This reflects a broader Scientology doctrine that proper auditing *requires* the E-meter for both safety and efficacy.

## Handling Restimulation While Studying

**Original Warning:**

> “Studying these incidents may be discovered to be **restimulative** to the student. If so, he would find auditing them as restimulative. However, such restimulation is very easily resolved and, unless he feels close to the end of tolerance, **he should not be shy of auditing or studying the track**.”

**Summary Explanation:** Here Hubbard acknowledges a caution for the **reader/student** of this material: simply learning about these whole-track incidents can **“restimulate”** one’s own latent memories or discomfort. In other words, as you study the bizarre incidents in this book, you might experience unpleasant sensations or emotions being stirred up. However, he immediately assures that any restimulation is **“very easily resolved.”** The student or auditor is advised to **persist** with studying or auditing the whole track unless they truly feel at the *absolute limit* of what they can tolerate. In practical terms, if the material triggers some upset, the person should handle it (e.g. by getting some auditing or using techniques to discharge the upset) and then **continue with the work** – rather than quitting out of fear. Only if someone is genuinely at the end of their endurance should they refrain; otherwise, **don’t be overly timid** about confronting the whole track.

**Context / Intended Audience:** This caution is aimed at **Scientology practitioners and students** engaging with *A History of Man*. It appears early in the book as Hubbard introduces the incident data. The context is that Hubbard knew the content (past lives, traumatic events from millions of years ago, etc.) might provoke reactions in readers. The warning serves to **prepare and encourage** readers – presumably trained auditors or serious students – to handle any personal discomfort through standard Scientology means and keep going. It acknowledges the phenomena of **restimulation** (a key concept in Dianetics where simply recalling or mentioning an incident can key it in) and counsels the reader to treat it as a solvable issue rather than a reason to stop studying.

**Cross-References:** Notably, Hubbard originally issued this material in a limited form titled *“What to Audit”* (as indicated on the title page) – implying there was some early caution about wide distribution. In the preface, he even mentions that some people warned him not to release this data for fear of dire “repercussion” nationwide, though he personally found those fears unfounded. The advice above shows Hubbard’s confidence that **most people can handle the whole-track data** with proper tech, and it aligns with Scientology practice that if study brings on restimulation, one should **apply auditing to resolve it** rather than shy away. (In modern Scientology, similar ideas appear in study tech and auditing training: confront difficulties rather than avoid them.)

## Avoid Running Incidents Literally

**Original Warning:**

> “Do not in any case let \[the preclear] get an actual **FAC 1 “coffee-grinder.”** … **The auditor should not**, however, **run the actual incident**, but should study *SCIENTOLOGY 8-8008* to discover how to **approximate the incident with mock-ups**.”

**Summary Explanation:** Hubbard cautions auditors **never to throw a preclear directly into the most extreme “whole track” incidents** (for example, the notorious implant called *Facsimile One*). In the text he gives the specific example of *Fac One*’s **“coffee-grinder”** device – the auditor must *not* allow the preclear’s imagination or recall to actually **reconstruct that device in full** during auditing. More generally, **don’t run the actual incident itself** as it happened. Instead, the auditor should employ **“creative processing”**: use *mock-ups* (imagined scenarios or objects) that *approximate* the incident’s content, thereby **defusing** the trauma gradually. By having the preclear *safely mock up elements* similar to the incident (but **not so close that they relive it fully**), the painful facsimile will erode (“desensitize”) without the person being overwhelmed. Hubbard directs auditors to the book *Scientology 8-8008* for these techniques, reinforcing that **the correct approach is to dilute and parallel the incident** with invented scenarios until its charge is gone – *never* slam the preclear with the raw incident outright.

**Context / Intended Audience:** This warning is given as part of the **technical instructions to auditors** using *A History of Man*. Hubbard places it in his discussion (in Chapter One) of how to approach the catalog of incidents. The intended audience is **experienced auditors** who might be eager to run dramatic incidents like Facsimile One on their preclears. Hubbard is effectively saying: *yes*, these incidents are on the case, but handle them **indirectly** and artfully. He even notes auditors can often *recognize* which incident a case is sitting in (from clues like a preclear’s glasses or ailments), but he insists on **gradual, “parallel” processing** rather than literal replay. The context underscores the experimental, **potentially perilous nature** of running whole-track implants, and Hubbard’s solution – grounded in prior research – is to **use creative mock-ups and metaphors** guided by the auditor’s knowledge, instead of re-enacting the incident scene-for-scene.

**Cross-References:** Hubbard’s emphasis on using *mock-ups* comes directly from the creative processing methods introduced in *Scientology 8-8008 (1952)*. In that book he explained that **mock-up technique can break the power of traumatic facsimiles** without addressing them head-on. Here in *History of Man*, we see that principle in action: e.g. rather than the actual “coffee-grinder” torture device, use a harmless **analogy** (Hubbard suggests something like a camera on a tripod, etc.) to bleed off the trauma. Additionally, Hubbard mentions **“TECHNIQUE 80”** in this context – another early 1950s process for heavy incidents – indicating that the auditor should employ all relevant advanced techniques to gently ease into whole-track memories. In summary, this warning aligns with the broader doctrine that **high-charge incidents must be approached via gradient**: Scientology teaches not to overwhelm a preclear’s mind with too direct a challenge, but to erode aberrations step by step.

## Don’t Share “Whole Track” Incidents with Outsiders

**Original Warning:**

> “Your discussion of these incidents with the **uninitiated** in Scientology can **produce havoc**. Should you describe ‘**the clam**’ to someone, you may **restimulate** it in him to the extent of causing severe **jaw hinge pain**…. The clam and all these incidents are very much present in the GE and can be restimulated easily. **So do not be sadistic** with your describing them to people—…”

**Summary Explanation:** Hubbard gives a colorful warning that **talking about certain whole-track incidents to people who haven’t learned Scientology can actually cause them harm**. In particular, he mentions the incident of “*the Clam*” – one of the evolutionary memories on the Genetic Entity line – and says if you tell someone about the clam’s fate, you might **restimulate** that memory in them and provoke real physical pain (in this case, severe jaw pain, since the “clam” creature had a hinge problem). He even cites anecdotes of people who, after merely hearing the clam story, experienced jaw lock or needed teeth pulled due to the triggered ache. The overarching point is that these ancient incidents are **buried in everyone’s reactive mind (the GE)**, so **casually describing them can key-in those incidents** in an unprepared person. Therefore, Hubbard admonishes readers **not to share these incident tales with the uninitiated**, as it would be irresponsible or “sadistic” to do so. (He half-jokingly notes an exception: if someone belligerently insists that humans have no evolutionary memory, you might describe the clam to “make a believer” out of them – but this is said tongue-in-cheek, acknowledging it would likely result in a visit to the dentist!)

**Context / Intended Audience:** This warning is a **side-note to Scientologists themselves**, likely those enthusiastic about the whole-track revelations. It appears in the section where Hubbard is discussing the **Genetic Entity (GE) line** incidents – incidents along the evolutionary chain of the body. The intended audience is anyone reading the book (auditor or lay Scientologist) who might be tempted to talk about these fantastical incidents with friends, family, or the public. The context reveals Hubbard’s concern with **“restimulation outside of session.”** In Dianetics and Scientology practice, it’s generally frowned upon to trigger someone’s case outside of a controlled auditing session. Here he explicitly connects that principle to this book’s content: these incidents are potent, so **keep them within the bounds of auditing or Scientology circles.** It’s also a bit of a **public relations caution** – by implying that telling these stories can cause pain, he’s warning Scientologists that non-Scientologists won’t react well (not only socially but even physically).

**Cross-References:** Earlier in the book Hubbard introduces the concept of the **Genetic Entity (GE)** – essentially the “somatic mind” that carries physical evolutionary memories. He explains that the GE is **“not an actual individual but a composite of individualities assumed in the single lives along the evolutionary track.”** This doctrine is the basis for the clam story: the **GE retains the trauma of the clam and other stages**, making them live hazards if restimulated. The warning here parallels Hubbard’s general stance that **processing should occur in auditing, with an auditor and meter** – not via casual conversation. (In broader Scientology practice, similar advice appears in policies about not discussing one’s case or others’ case outside of session, to avoid restimulation.) The “clam” anecdote itself has become infamous in Scientology lore and is often cited as an example of Hubbard’s cautionary humor – he genuinely claims people can psychosomatically “catch jaw trouble” from hearing it, illustrating the alleged power of these implants and the **need for care when handling or even talking about them**.

## Caution Auditing Theta vs. MEST Body

**Original Warning:**

> “There is just one warning about **theta line** incidents: you are auditing the theta ‘body’, not the MEST body. It is theoretically possible to run an incident out of the theta being **which is too much for the MEST body**… A MEST body with a weak heart had better be audited in this lifetime only until his heart condition vanishes. Some of the theta line incidents **kick back so hard** against the MEST body that the preclear is sure he will not live through them… If the auditor doesn’t balance the overt against the motivator… he may be embarrassed by **making a theta clear before his time**—the body still lying about **but not breathing**.”

**Summary Explanation:** Hubbard issues a **serious caution about the physical risks** when auditing extremely heavy past-life incidents. The “theta line” refers to the sequence of experiences of the thetan (spirit) across lifetimes, as opposed to the Genetic Entity’s evolutionary line. The warning is that when dredging up intense theta-line incidents, **the preclear’s physical body (MEST body) can be severely affected**. In fact, one could run an incident that the **spirit can handle but the flesh cannot** – e.g. a person with a weak heart might literally suffer heart failure if pushed too far, too fast into a traumatic past-life memory. Hubbard describes that some of these incidents hit the body with such force (pain, shock, etc.) that the person *feels* like they might die in session. He even half-jokes that an overzealous auditor could inadvertently cause the preclear to go “**theta clear**” (exteriorize permanently) with the **body dropping dead** (“not breathing”) on the couch. To avoid such calamity, the auditor must proceed with great care: **audit a frail person on current-life stuff first**, strengthen them up, and when running whole-track, always **balance the overt and motivator** (i.e. run both sides of the incident). This balance prevents over-driving one type of charge (like suffering without relief or vice versa). In essence, the warning is: *Don’t kill your preclear by running something beyond their body’s tolerance* – **tailor the auditing to their physical capacity.**

**Context / Intended Audience:** This caution is found in the section of the book dealing with advanced incidents on the **“theta line” (past lives and spiritual trauma)**. It is explicitly aimed at **trained auditors**, particularly those using *History of Man* to run whole-track incidents. The context assumes the reader has knowledge of earlier Scientology techniques (Hubbard references “80” – i.e. *Technique 80* – and the book *8-8008* in the surrounding text). The intended audience is warned that even though these processes can produce Clears or Theta Clears, they carry **material risks** if misapplied. This is essentially a **safety briefing for auditors** handling high-octane case phenomena: Hubbard acknowledges the potential for psychosomatic or even somatic shock. It reflects the experimental nature of early Scientology research into past lives, where auditors were pushing the envelope and Hubbard needed to insert a **life-or-death disclaimer**. It’s also one of the few places he outright implies auditing could be fatal if one is careless – highlighting how **profoundly “real” the whole-track somatics are considered to be**.

**Cross-References:** Hubbard presumes here that the auditor is well-versed in *Scientology 8-8008* techniques. Just prior to this warning, he notes that **if these incidents are hard to run, it means the auditor “doesn’t know 8-8008.”** Conversely, when properly trained, *“theta line incidents are easy to audit if the auditor knows 8-8008.”* This ties the warning to the broader doctrine that **only highly skilled auditors should attempt whole-track clearing**, and they must use the correct procedures (from 8-8008, Technique 80, etc.). Additionally, the concept of a **“Theta Clear”** – a being freed from the body – is mentioned. Later Scientology materials describe Theta Clear as a state where the thetan is stable outside the body; here Hubbard wryly uses it to mean accidentally knocking the thetan out of the body via death. The warning thus also connects to the idea that **auditing can affect the body powerfully** (a concept also seen in Dianetics, where running engrams can produce intense physical reactions). In summary, this caution reinforces Scientology’s stress on **gradients and preparedness**: one must build up a preclear’s strength (even physical health) and auditor’s skill before tackling the really “heavy” incidents.

## No Words in Early “Electronic” Incidents

**Original Warning:**

> **“WARNING:** Don’t ever try to run words or other perceptions out of any **electronic incidents**. Words are seldom included in them. Communication in such an era was usually by thought transfer, not by words. **This is very important.**”

**Summary Explanation:** Hubbard alerts auditors that in certain ancient traumatic incidents – specifically those he calls **“electronic incidents”** (which often involve high-tech equipment, electromagnetics, or implant scenarios on the whole track) – **they should not expect to find spoken language or sounds**. In auditing, one normally might ask a preclear for any words or phrases heard in an incident (since words can be keys to engrams). But here Hubbard emphatically says **“Don’t ever try”** that approach on electronic incidents. **Why?** Because, he explains, in those far-back times communication didn’t happen with spoken words at all; it was done via **thought transfer (telepathy)**. In short, an auditor hunting for a verbal phrase in a 50-million-year-old space opera implant is wasting their time and could mislead the session. The warning underscores that **the auditor must adjust technique to the incident’s era** – focus on mental image pictures, force, emotions, etc., but **not words**, since there likely aren’t any. Hubbard emphasizes “This is very important,” indicating that failing to heed this could stall the auditing or give incorrect results (the preclear might dub in words that never existed, for example).

**Context / Intended Audience:** This warning is found in the portion of *A History of Man* where Hubbard is describing various **advanced whole-track phenomena** – things like “Borrowing,” “Nipping,” “Blanketing,” and other esoteric incidents that involve disembodied thetans and high technology. The intended audience is **auditors who are running these peculiar incidents** on preclears. By the time an auditor is addressing “electronic incidents,” they are dealing with very early track (often dubbed “space opera” events in Scientology). Hubbard’s caution serves as a **technical tip**: it assumes the auditor knows standard procedure (like checking for audible content in engrams) but tells them to **override that instinct in this special case**. The context implies that these incidents predate language or were done by civilizations using telepathy, so the auditor must operate accordingly. Essentially, it’s a reminder that **the usual rules of Dianetic auditing (e.g. find the words spoken in the incident) don’t apply universally** – and that blind adherence to routine could mess up these sessions.

**Cross-References:** This idea aligns with Scientology’s broader teachings that in early periods of the “Whole Track,” or among advanced beings, **communication is often non-verbal**. For example, Scientology philosophy holds that theta beings can communicate thought-to-thought without a physical language (sometimes called *“theta communication”*). Hubbard’s **“Chart of Attitudes”** and other lectures suggest that as one ascends to higher states of being, words become unnecessary – a concept mirrored by this warning. In practice, this caution would also resonate with auditors trained on *Scientology 8-8008*, where creative processing might involve non-verbal techniques. While *History of Man* doesn’t cite a specific external source here, the warning implicitly references the notion that some incidents (like high-level implants) occurred in an era or context completely foreign to normal human experience (telepathic, no spoken dialogue). Thus, the auditor should **adjust their approach based on Hubbard’s description of that era**. The take-home message in doctrine: **don’t impose present-time expectations (like spoken language) on an incident that predates or bypasses such conventions** – instead, address the incident through concepts and intentions, as those are the form of communication the preclear would have used then.

## Facsimile One’s “Summons” Requires Care

**Original Warning:**

> “The header wanted people to report when sent for. **Thus the context (*which must never be done until the emotion and effort are reduced*)** when the vagus area was ‘bapped’ concentrates on getting the preclear to report quickly when summoned and makes him terrified of arrest, of courts, of other legal hocus-pocus.”

**Summary Explanation:** This is a **specific caution regarding the Facsimile One incident**, one of the most notorious implants Hubbard describes. Within Facsimile One, there is a portion where the subject is **“summoned to court”** – essentially commanded by an authority figure (the “header”) via a painful vagus nerve impulse (a “bap” to the stomach) to present themselves. Hubbard warns that an auditor **must never attempt to run this “summons to court” sequence in context until the preclear’s emotional charge and physical pain (effort) from the incident have been reduced**. In simpler terms: Fac One is so overwhelming that you **first run out the raw terror, the physical agony, etc., of the implant *before* trying to address the narrative context** that “you must obey summons.” If an auditor were to immediately jump into the storyline (“You are being summoned to court, respond to the command!”) while the preclear is still engulfed in the fear and pain, it could re-trigger intense anxiety or compliance reactions. Only after the person has been alleviated of the bulk of the emotional shock and bodily effort from the incident should the auditor guide them through that aspect of the memory. This ensures that the preclear can confront the authoritative command element without being re-traumatized or “re-implanted” by it.

**Context / Intended Audience:** The context here is Hubbard’s detailed exposition of **Facsimile One**, which he describes as an implant laid down millions of years ago to control beings. This warning is aimed at **auditors who are running Fac One on a preclear** (something only an advanced auditor would dare, given the incident’s intensity). Hubbard is effectively inserting a *step-by-step auditing instruction*: break Fac One’s run into phases. The intended audience is presumably those auditors who have gotten a read on Fac One on the E-meter and are attempting to erase it. Hubbard’s tone indicates he is sharing a *hard-earned insight* from research: that the “summons” portion has to be held off until the preclear isn’t drowning in the rest of the incident’s trauma. The presence of this warning highlights how **tricky and procedural auditing an implant can be** – one must know the incident’s stages and handle them in the right order. It’s a safeguard so the auditor doesn’t inadvertently reinforce the command “report when summoned” while the preclear is still deeply hypnotized by the implant’s power.

**Cross-References:** This caution is a concrete example of Hubbard applying the general principle of **gradients in auditing** (as seen in earlier warnings). It complements the broader advice **“Avoid Running Incidents Literally”** – here applied specifically to Facsimile One. Indeed, Hubbard earlier noted one should not even let a preclear near an actual mock-up of the Fac One machine; now he adds not to run a crucial *part* of that incident until preparatory work is done. For additional context, Hubbard describes *Facsimile One* as *“an outright control mechanism”* used by an alien invader to create a subservient, religiously obsessed populace. The “summons to court” effect is a key element of that control (instilling fear of authority and courts), which is why he stresses special care in auditing it. In Scientology doctrine, this also resonates with the idea that **implants have multiple layers** – pain, emotion, and command – which often must be taken apart layer by layer. The warning references reducing *“emotion and effort”*: those are two of the components of an engram (along with thought), per Dianetics theory. Hubbard is effectively saying **handle the emotion and effort first, then the thought/command**. This stepwise approach is taught in various auditing techniques. Thus, this Fac One warning is a specific instance of a general rule: **never run the cognitive content of an implant (the ideas or commands) until the raw pain and emotion are largely discharged**.

## Limits of Self-Auditing (No E-Meter)

**Original Warning:**

> “People who keep running incidents **without any recourse to an E-meter** will achieve much with the body, very little with the thetan—hence there is **no rise in tone**… In people who continually **self-audit** without direction, the thetan is just being very propitiative toward MEST bodies and is giving the entities a wonderful work-out. **The body gets better sometimes. The thetan never gets better.**”

**Summary Explanation:** In this caution, Hubbard addresses the scenario of a person (or auditor) who tries to run incidents **indefinitely without using an E-meter or proper guidance** – essentially *unsupervised or unguided auditing*. He explains that doing so can produce some improvement on a **physical level** (the body might feel relief from certain ailments as incidents are discharged), **but it yields no real progress for the thetan** (the person’s spiritual being). In technical terms, despite many hours of such work, there is “no rise in tone” on the emotional/spiritual tone scale – meaning the person’s fundamental case level doesn’t improve. Hubbard says that a thetan who is self-auditing blindly is often just being **“propitiative”** (appeasing) toward the body and its reactive minds (he calls them “entities” here), giving those body-bound entities lots of exercise but **neglecting his own advancement**. The vivid conclusion – “The body gets better… The thetan never gets better.” – drives home that **without standard procedure (like E-meter feedback and an auditor’s direction), the core being isn’t being freed**. In short, **endless solo running of incidents or unauthorized tinkering** might alleviate some psychosomatic ills, but it won’t produce the enlightenment or Clear status that Scientology aims for.

**Context / Intended Audience:** This warning comes toward the **end of the book**, as Hubbard is summarizing how to truly make a thetan better using the techniques (he provides two “remedies,” one of which is the E-meter, in the surrounding text). The audience here includes **auditors and also any Scientologist who might think to audit themselves**. Hubbard knew that once people learned about whole-track incidents, some might try to handle their case solo or informally. This caution essentially says: *that won’t work well.* It reinforces the need for the formal auditing structure. The context is also a bit of a **justification for the E-meter and auditor’s role** – Hubbard is pointing out why simply recalling past traumas or doing Dianetic techniques on oneself, without the meter’s guidance and without an objective auditor, is largely ineffective for true spiritual gain. The mention of “entities” refers to the idea (explored earlier in the text) that a person’s body is infested with various sub-beings or impressions; self-auditing often ends up addressing those rather than the thetan itself. This is a nuanced point, but the overall message is clear: **only standard, meter-guided auditing can systematically improve the thetan’s condition**.

**Cross-References:** This warning reinforces Hubbard’s earlier instructions about the **necessity of the E-meter** in serious auditing. In the introduction, he flatly stated that without an E-meter these incidents *“cannot be audited with … safety”*. Here at the conclusion, he adds that without the meter (and proper direction), auditing doesn’t achieve the core goal (raising the being’s tone level). Together, these form bookends: **start with an E-meter, end with an E-meter**. The warning also ties into a fundamental doctrine: Scientology is *not* a do-it-yourself practice; it requires the structured auditor-preclear dynamic. Hubbard elsewhere established that *“the quickest route to Clear is with a trained auditor”*, and that solo attempts early on are counterproductive. Additionally, the reference to “entities” alludes to material that would later be expanded in the *Operating Thetan (OT)* levels (the idea of body thetans, etc.), where again Hubbard insists one must follow the precise procedures to get rid of them. While *History of Man* predates the OT levels, Hubbard is already hinting that a thetan can be distracted by handling things that aren’t really *him*. The remedy for that is an auditor who can keep the thetan on track (pun intended). In summary, this caution underscores a core tenet of the doctrine: **Auditing is a guided process – attempts to circumvent the technology (like working without the meter or solo beyond one’s training) will fall short of true spiritual liberation.**
