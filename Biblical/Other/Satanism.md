# Satanism — Biblical Warnings

> "Biblical Roast of the Occult: sober, evidence‑based cautions against Satanic doctrines."

## Overview
Satanism, whether atheistic (LaVeyan), theistic, or self‑styled blends of chaos magic and occult ritual, is united by one thesis: **exalt the self above the Creator**. Scripture sees this instinct not as edgy liberation but as the oldest rebellion in the cosmos (Gen 3:5; Isa 14:12‑15; Ezek 28:2). What follows is a concise catalogue of biblical warnings that speak directly to the claims of modern Satanism.

| 1 | Self‑Deification    | Gen 3:1‑5; Isa 14:13‑15 | The promise “you will be like gods” ends in expulsion and ruin.                                   |

## Expanded Analysis

### 1—Self‑Deification
*Genesis 3:5; Isaiah 14:12‑15*  
The serpent’s original lure—"ye shall be as gods"—reappears in LaVey’s credo of self‑worship. Isaiah situates that boast in Lucifer’s downfall: ascent turns to plummet. No worldview built on self‑enthronement escapes the gravity of creaturely limits.

### 2—False Freedom
*John 8:34‑36; 2 Peter 2:19*  
Promising emancipation, Satanism shrugs off external moral law, yet Jesus diagnoses sin as a slave‑driver. Liberation without truth is a gilded cage; only the Son breaks the chains.

### 3—Blasphemy & Mockery
*Galatians 6:7; Hebrews 10:29‑31*  
Ritual inversions of baptism or Eucharist may look theatrical, but Scripture insists God is not mocked. Persistent profanation courts irreversible judgment.

### 4—Occult Ritual
*Leviticus 19:31; Deuteronomy 18:10‑12*  
Summoning spirits or channeling "infernal" forces transgresses explicit bans. The biblical narrative portrays such traffic as doorway, not playroom—one that lets the thief in to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10).

### 5—Exploitation
*2 Timothy 3:2‑6; Matthew 18:6*  
A moral code that prizes power and indulgence cultivates abusers. Jesus warns that harming "little ones" carries a sentence worse than drowning with a millstone.

### 6—Final Destiny
*Revelation 20:10‑15*  
The endgame is not metaphor. The dragon, the beast, and every name not found in the Book of Life are cast into the lake of fire. Aligning with the accuser is choosing the accuser’s fate.

## Concluding Charge
> "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." — *James 4:7*

Every human is offered the same crossroads: self‑exaltation or Christ‑exaltation. One leads to ruin, the other to resurrection. **Choose wisely.**
