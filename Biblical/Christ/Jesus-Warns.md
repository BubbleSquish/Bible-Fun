## Beware of False Prophets (Matthew 7:15)

**Context:**  
- Jesus was teaching the crowds in the Sermon on the Mount, laying out the principles of righteous living. Just before this warning, He urged His listeners to **choose the narrow way** that leads to life, rather than the broad road to destruction (Matthew 7:13-14).  
- He explained that comparatively **few find the path** to life, emphasizing the difficulty and importance of true discipleship (Matthew 7:14 ([Matthew Chapter 7 - King James Bible Scriptures (KJV)](https://sarata.com/bible/chapter/Matthew.7.html#7:15#:~:text=Matthew%207%3A14))).  
- Immediately following that, Jesus **transitioned to caution** the people about influences that could mislead them on this journey â€“ namely, false religious teachers (Matthew 7:15).

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepâ€™s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves**.</span> (Matthew 7:15, KJV) ([Matthew Chapter 7 - King James Bible Scriptures (KJV)](https://sarata.com/bible/chapter/Matthew.7.html#7:15#:~:text=Matthew%207%3A15))

**Meaning:** Jesus warns that not everyone who claims to speak for God is genuine. **False prophets** may appear harmless or pious (<span style="color:red">in sheepâ€™s clothing</span>), but their true nature is dangerous (<span style="color:red">ravening wolves</span>). Believers must be discerning. In the verses that follow, Jesus explains we can **know them by their fruits** â€“ their actions and teachings will eventually reveal their true character (Matthew 7:16-20). This warning is a call to vigilance so that we are not deceived by leaders who **pretend to be godly** but lead people away from Godâ€™s truth.

**Example in Scripture:** An Old Testament example of a false prophet is **Hananiah** in Jeremiahâ€™s day. He lied to the people, claiming God would bring peace when God had not spoken to him. The true prophet Jeremiah rebuked Hananiahâ€™s deceit and foretold Godâ€™s judgment on him. Indeed, **<span style="color:red">Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month</span>** as punishment for his false prophecies (Jeremiah 28:17). Hananiahâ€™s fate shows the deadly peril of speaking lies in Godâ€™s name â€“ exactly what Jesus warns against.

## Beware of False Messiahs and Deception (Matthew 24:4-5)

**Context:**  
- During Holy Week, Jesusâ€™s disciples privately asked Him **when the Temple would be destroyed and what sign would signal His coming and the end of the age** (Matthew 24:3 ([Bible, King James Version](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV2&byte=4488723#:~:text=,Christ%3B%20and%20shall%20deceive%20many))). This prompted Jesusâ€™s extended prophecy about the last days (the Olivet Discourse).  
- Jesus began His reply with a general caution before giving any signs. He wanted the disciples to first be on guard against **being led astray** (Matthew 24:4).  
- He warned that **many impostors** would appear: individuals falsely claiming to be the Messiah, who would mislead large numbers of people (Matthew 24:5).

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Take heed that no man deceive you**. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; **and shall deceive many**.</span> (Matthew 24:4-5, KJV) ([Bible, King James Version](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV2&byte=4488723#:~:text=,Christ%3B%20and%20shall%20deceive%20many))

**Meaning:** In tumultuous times, people are vulnerable to spiritual deception. Jesus cautions His followers to be vigilant (<span style="color:red">take heed</span>) because **false christs** and self-proclaimed saviors will arise. These deceivers may use Jesusâ€™s name or messianic titles and will **lead many people astray**. The warning implies that Christians must stay rooted in Jesusâ€™s true teaching so they wonâ€™t be fooled by charismatic pretenders or sensational claims about Christâ€™s return. **No matter how convincing the impostor**, disciples should not believe anyone who claims to be Christ appearing incognito, because Jesus had made it clear His return would be unmistakable (see Matthew 24:27).

**Example in Scripture:** Not long after Jesusâ€™s ascension, there were indeed such deceivers. The Book of Acts records that **false messianic figures** arose and drew followers. For example, **Theudas** boasted himself to be somebody great, and about 400 men rallied to him. But, as Gamaliel recounted, Theudas was killed and all his followers were scattered ([Acts 5:36 Some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.](https://biblehub.com/acts/5-36.htm#:~:text=King%20James%20Bible%20For%20before,scattered%2C%20and%20brought%20to%20nought)). *<span style="color:red">For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody;â€¦ who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</span>* (Acts 5:36, KJV) ([Acts 5:36 Some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.](https://biblehub.com/acts/5-36.htm#:~:text=For%20before%20these%20days%20rose,scattered%2C%20and%20brought%20to%20nought)). Similarly, another leader, Judas of Galilee, led people in revolt and met a bitter end (Acts 5:37). These examples confirm Jesusâ€™s warning: false messiahs did come, misled many, and led their followers to disaster.

## Beware of Hypocrisy â€“ The Leaven of the Pharisees (Luke 12:1)

**Context:**  
- Shortly after a tense confrontation in which Jesus denounced the Phariseesâ€™ and lawyersâ€™ hypocrisy (Luke 11:37-52), those leaders began to assail Him fiercely and **lay traps in debate** (Luke 11:53-54).  
- Immediately following this, as **crowds gathered by the thousands**, Jesus turned first to instruct His disciples in the hearing of all (Luke 12:1).  
- Given the recent conflict, Jesus specifically **warned His disciples about the Phariseesâ€™ corrupting influence**, metaphorically referring to it as <span style="color:red">leaven</span> (yeast) which can spread unseen through dough.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy**.</span> (Luke 12:1, KJV) ([Bible Verses About Beware: 26 Scriptures on Beware](https://sarata.com/bible/verses/about/beware.html#:~:text=Luke%2012%3A1))

**Meaning:** Leaven is a small ingredient that spreads through an entire loaf. Jesus uses it to symbolize how the **hypocrisy of the Pharisees** â€“ their false piety and hidden sin â€“ can spread and infect others. He is warning the disciples not to **imitate the Phariseesâ€™ behavior** or adopt their teachings. The Pharisees appeared very religious outwardly, but were corrupt and unbelieving in heart. Their example could <span style="color:red">spread</span> to Jesusâ€™s followers if not guarded against. In essence, Jesus cautions us to beware a **religion of outward show** without inner righteousness. Such hypocrisy, if tolerated, can permeate and ruin the community of believers.

**Example in Scripture:** The **Pharisees themselves** are the prime example of this warning. Jesus said they were like whitewashed tombs â€“ outwardly beautiful but full of uncleanness inside ([Matthew 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng#:~:text=27%20Woe%20unto%20you%2C%20scribes,and%20of%20all%20%2096)). He pronounced woe on them for appearing righteous while **<span style="color:red">within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</span>** (Matthew 23:28, KJV) ([Matthew 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng#:~:text=27%20Woe%20unto%20you%2C%20scribes,and%20of%20all%20%2096)). One specific example is how they **devoured widowsâ€™ houses while making long prayers** for show, an act of greed and pretense for which Jesus said they would <span style="color:red">receive the greater damnation</span> (Luke 20:46-47, cf. Matthew 23:14 ([Matthew 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng#:~:text=13%20%C2%B6%20But%20woe%20unto,are%20entering%20to%20go%20in))). Their **hypocrisy** not only brought Godâ€™s judgment on themselves, but it misled others. Jesus noted that when the Pharisees made a convert, they turned him into <span style="color:red">twofold more the child of hell</span> than themselves (Matthew 23:15) ([Matthew 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng#:~:text=platter%2C%20that%20the%20outside%20of,them%20may%20be%20clean%20also)), multiplying hypocrisy. This is exactly the corrupting <span style="color:red">leaven</span> Jesus urges His followers to avoid.

## Beware of the Scribes (Prideful Religious Leaders) (Mark 12:38)

**Context:**  
- In the days leading up to His crucifixion, Jesus taught publicly in the Temple. He had just silenced various groups of Jewish leaders who tried to entangle Him with tricky questions â€“ Pharisees about paying taxes, Sadducees about the resurrection, and a scribe about the greatest commandment (Mark 12:13-34).  
- After demonstrating His authority and wisdom, Jesus issued a warning about certain religious leaders to the listening crowd.  
- Specifically, **He cautioned the people about the scribes**, the professional teachers of the Law, whose outward religiosity masked a love of status and money. This warning comes right before Jesus observes a poor widow giving her offering, in stark contrast to the greedy scribes (Mark 12:41-44).

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Beware of the scribes**, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplacesâ€¦</span> (Mark 12:38, KJV) ([Mark 12:38 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Mark-12-38/#:~:text=And%20he%20said%20unto%20them,love%20salutations%20in%20the%20marketplaces))

**Meaning:** The **scribes** were the Bible scholars of their day, but many had fallen into pride and corruption. Jesus warns the public not to be impressed by the scribesâ€™ pompous displays of religion. They enjoyed walking around in fine religious robes, basking in respectful greetings and the best seats in the synagogues and banquets (Mark 12:38-39). Yet, as Jesus notes, these same men **<span style="color:red">devour widowsâ€™ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers</span>** (Mark 12:40) â€“ meaning they exploit the vulnerable (taking advantage of widows) while maintaining a faÃ§ade of piety. The warning urges discernment: **do not emulate or trust leaders who are in love with their own honor and who use religion for gain**. God sees their hearts, and as Jesus says, <span style="color:red">These shall receive greater damnation</span> (Mark 12:40). In short, *beware of religious pride and greed* as exemplified by the scribes.

**Example in Scripture:** The behavior of **Eliâ€™s sons**, Hophni and Phinehas, in the Old Testament is an example of corrupt spiritual leaders akin to those scribes. As priests, they were meant to serve God humbly, but they abused their position: they **greedily took the best portions** of sacrifices for themselves and lived immorally (1 Samuel 2:12-17,22). Their sin caused people to abhor the offerings of the Lord. Godâ€™s judgment on them was severe â€“ both sons died on the same day in battle as a divine punishment, and the ark of God was lost. *<span style="color:red">And the ark of God was taken; **and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain**.</span>* (1 Samuel 4:11, KJV) ([1 Samuel 4:11-22 KJV - "And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of ..."](https://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/1-samuel/passage/?q=1+samuel+4:11-22#:~:text=11%20%20%20And%20the,36)). This tragic end mirrors Jesusâ€™s warning: religious leaders who **serve self instead of God** will not escape Godâ€™s condemnation. Just as Eliâ€™s sons perished for their greed and irreverence, Jesus declared that scribes who preyed on widows under a cloak of religion would receive a harsh judgment from God.

## Beware of Covetousness (Greed) (Luke 12:15)

**Context:**  
- On one occasion, as Jesus was teaching a crowd, **a man interrupted** with a request: he wanted Jesus to mediate an inheritance dispute with his brother (Luke 12:13).  
- Jesus refused to act as an arbitrator over money and used the moment to address the **heart issue of greed** behind the manâ€™s request (Luke 12:14).  
- Before even telling a parable, Jesus gave the crowd a clear warning about covetousness. He then followed it with the Parable of the Rich Fool to illustrate the point (Luke 12:16-21).

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Take heed, and beware of covetousness**: for a manâ€™s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</span> (Luke 12:15, KJV) ([Bible Verses About Beware: 26 Scriptures on Beware](https://sarata.com/bible/verses/about/beware.html#:~:text=Luke%2012%3A15))

**Meaning:** Jesus makes it explicit that **greed (covetousness)** is a spiritual danger. <span style="color:red">Take heed and beware</span> is a double caution, underscoring how vigilant we must be against the desire for more and more material wealth. He reminds us that **life is far more than possessions**. Oneâ€™s worth or security is not measured by how much stuff one has. This warning shifts our perspective to eternal values: accumulating wealth does not secure oneâ€™s soul. Immediately after, Jesus tells of a rich man who hoarded goods but died that night, leaving everything behind â€“ *<span style="color:red">So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God</span>* (Luke 12:21). The warning urges us to guard our hearts against materialism, because **greed can quietly consume us and draw us away from God**.

**Example in Scripture:** A sobering example of covetousness is **Achan** in the Old Testament. When Jericho fell, God commanded Israel not to take any of the spoils, yet Achan secretly **coveted and stole** a beautiful robe and some silver and gold. He admitted, *<span style="color:red">I sawâ€¦a goodly Babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silverâ€¦ **then I coveted them, and took them**.</span>* (Joshua 7:21, KJV) ([Joshua 7:21-22 KJV - "When I saw among the spoils a goodly ...](https://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/joshua/passage/?q=joshua+7:21-22#:~:text=Joshua%207%3A21,weight%2C%20then%20I%20coveted)). This act of greed brought disaster: Israel was defeated in the next battle, and when Achanâ€™s sin was discovered, **he and all he had were destroyed**. *<span style="color:red">And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this dayâ€¦ **all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire**</span>* (Joshua 7:25, KJV) ([Joshua 7:25 "Why have you brought this trouble upon us ... - Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-25.htm#:~:text=And%20Joshua%20said%3A%20%27Why%20hast,them%20with%20fire%2C%20and)). Achanâ€™s death shows the high cost of covetousness. Likewise, Jesus warns that **greed brings ruin** â€“ maybe not always as dramatically as Achanâ€™s case, but ultimately, a greedy heart will lead one to <span style="color:red">perish</span> like the rich fool in the parable (Luke 12:20). We are called instead to be <span style="color:red">rich toward God</span> â€“ valuing generosity and godliness over earthly gain.

## Beware of Persecutors (Beware of Men) (Matthew 10:17)

**Context:**  
- Jesus gave this warning while **sending out the Twelve Apostles** on a mission to preach the kingdom of God (Matthew 10:5-7). He empowered them to heal and cast out demons, and instructed them to depend on Godâ€™s provision through hospitable listeners (Matthew 10:8-14).  
- He also forewarned them that not everyone would receive their message. Just before this verse, Jesus said, <span style="color:red">I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves</span> and told them to be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves (Matthew 10:16).  
- In that context, Jesus plainly warned the disciples about coming **opposition and persecution**. He told them to *expect* hostility from certain people (<span style="color:red">men</span>) and authorities.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**But beware of men**: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.</span> (Matthew 10:17, KJV) ([Bible Verses About Beware: 26 Scriptures on Beware](https://sarata.com/bible/verses/about/beware.html#:~:text=Matthew%2010%3A17))

**Meaning:** Here <span style="color:red">men</span> refers to *hostile people* who would persecute Jesusâ€™s followers. Jesus is instructing His disciples to be **on guard** and not naive about human opposition. They would face arrests (<span style="color:red">deliver you to councils</span>), religious punishment (being flogged in synagogues), and later He even mentions being dragged before governors and kings (Matthew 10:18). <span style="color:red">Beware of men</span> means **be cautious and wise** in dealing with people; understand that not everyone will respond kindly to the gospel. Jesus wasnâ€™t telling them to fear or hate their persecutors (indeed, He also said <span style="color:red">fear not</span> â€“ Matthew 10:26 â€“ and to love enemies), but rather to be alert and prepared. The disciples needed eyes open to the reality of persecution so they wouldnâ€™t be caught off guard when it happened.

**Example in Scripture:** Soon after Jesusâ€™s resurrection, this warning proved true. The apostles encountered exactly the persecution Jesus described. For instance, the **apostle Paul (Saul of Tarsus)** initially acted as one of those <span style="color:red">wolves</span>: he hunted down Christians. *<span style="color:red">As for Saul, **he made havock of the church**, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</span>* (Acts 8:3, KJV) ([Acts 8:3 But Saul began to destroy the church. Going ... - Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm#:~:text=King%20James%20Bible%20As%20for,New%20King%20James%20Version)). He dragged believers before councils and helped orchestrate punishments. Similarly, in Acts 5 the apostles were **brought before the Jewish council** and beaten for preaching Christ (Acts 5:40). These are real-life fulfillments of Jesusâ€™s words. Jesus warned us so that when such persecution comes, we would not stumble or give up. The early Christians, armed with Jesusâ€™s warning, faced their trials with courage. They recognized that while human opponents could hurt them, they could not ultimately harm their souls (Matthew 10:28). Jesusâ€™s caution to <span style="color:red">beware of men</span> helped the disciples to be **vigilant, prudent, and steadfast** when opposition arose.

---

## Fear God Rather Than Men (Matthew 10:28; Luke 12:4-5)

**Context:**  
- Still in the context of sending out the Twelve (the same speech as the previous warning), Jesus addressed the **fear the disciples would feel** in the face of persecution. He had just told them not to fear their persecutors and that God cared even for sparrows and numbered their hairs (Matthew 10:26-31).  
- After encouraging them that they were valuable to the Father, Jesus laid down a fundamental principle: their **ultimate fear or reverence should be towards God**, not any human threats.  
- In Lukeâ€™s version, Jesus prefaces it with <span style="color:red">Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do</span> (Luke 12:4). Then comes this stark instruction about whom to fear.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather **fear Him**** which is **able to destroy both soul and body in hell**.</span> (Matthew 10:28, KJV) ([Matthew 10:28 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-10-28/#:~:text=Matthew%2010%3A28%20,%E2%80%9D%20King%20James))

**Meaning:** Jesus draws a contrast between **two types of fear**. On one hand, there are people who can harm or even kill the body â€“ but that is the extent of their power. On the other hand, **God has authority over eternal destiny** (<span style="color:red">soul and body in hell</span>). Therefore, our reverence and fear should be directed to God above all. This warning corrects our perspective: *donâ€™t be terrified of human opponents*, who at most can end your earthly life, but **do live in awe and fear of God**, who judges sin and controls eternity. Fearing God means to respect, obey, and acknowledge His supreme authority. This <span style="color:red">fear</span> isnâ€™t a cowering terror but a holy reverence that leads us to prioritize Godâ€™s approval over manâ€™s. In practice, Jesus was preparing His disciples to face threats and not cave in: if they feared God rightly, they would not **deny the truth** or compromise under pressure from men. 

**Example in Scripture:** In the Old Testament, **King Saul** serves as a cautionary example of fearing man over God. God had commanded Saul to utterly obey Him, but Saul disobeyed by sparing some forbidden spoil. When confronted, Saul admitted, *<span style="color:red">I have sinnedâ€¦ **because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice**.</span>* (1 Samuel 15:24, KJV) ([1 Samuel 15:24 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1-Samuel-15-24/#:~:text=1%20Samuel%2015%3A24%20,people%2C%20and%20obeyed%20their%20voice)). Saulâ€™s fear of public opinion led him to value pleasing the people above obeying God, and as a result, God rejected him from being king. He lost the kingdom because he **feared men more than God**. This illustrates Jesusâ€™s warning: Saul should have feared (reverenced) Godâ€™s command, but instead he was afraid of how the people would react. In contrast, Jesus calls us to courage: if we hold God in proper awe, we wonâ€™t buckle to human pressures. As another example, in the New Testament the apostle Peter initially **feared people** and denied knowing Jesus to save himself (Mark 14:66-72). But later, once filled with the Spirit and a strong fear of God, Peter boldly told the authorities, <span style="color:red">We ought to obey God rather than men</span> (Acts 5:29). The **right fear** enabled him to stand firm. Jesusâ€™ warning reminds us that ultimately, **Godâ€™s judgment is what matters**, not manâ€™s.

## Do Not Deny Christ Before Others (Matthew 10:32-33)

**Context:**  
- This warning comes as Jesus continued instructing the Twelve before sending them out. He had just encouraged them to acknowledge Him boldly, saying **<span style="color:red">Whoever confesses Me before men, I will also confess before My Father in heaven</span>** (Matthew 10:32).  
- Immediately after that positive promise, Jesus gave the flipside â€“ a solemn warning about the consequences of disowning Him.  
- By setting it in this context, Jesus was impressing on His disciples the **eternal importance of loyalty to Him**, especially in the face of persecution or public pressure.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven**.</span> (Matthew 10:33, KJV) ([Matthew 10:33 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-10-33/#:~:text=Matthew%2010%3A33%20,%E2%80%9D%20King%20James%20Version%20%28KJV))

**Meaning:** Jesus makes a direct connection: our willingness to **identify with Him** (or our refusal to do so) has eternal ramifications. To <span style="color:red">deny</span> Christ doesnâ€™t only mean verbally saying <span style="color:red">I donâ€™t know Him</span> (as Peter did), but broadly, being ashamed of Jesus or rejecting His lordship in order to avoid criticism or harm. Jesus warns that if someone **disowns Him publicly** â€“ rejects Him in word or lifestyle â€“ then on Judgment Day Jesus will likewise say to that person, <span style="color:red">I donâ€™t know you.</span> In other words, **refusing Christ means forfeiting salvation**, since Christ will not advocate for that person before the Father. This warning would later be echoed in Jesusâ€™s teaching that not everyone calling Him <span style="color:red">Lord</span> will enter the kingdom, but only those who truly follow Him (Matthew 7:21-23). Itâ€™s a concise and weighty warning: eternal acceptance by God hinges on oneâ€™s acceptance of His Son. Therefore, no earthly fear or favor should lead us to **deny our allegiance to Jesus**.

**Example in Scripture:** The apostle **Peter** famously faltered in this area â€“ though only temporarily. On the night of Jesusâ€™s arrest, Peter, out of fear, denied three times that he even knew Jesus. However, Peter **wept bitterly** in remorse (Luke 22:61-62) and was later restored by the risen Christ. Jesusâ€™s warning speaks to a more final denial â€“ an unrepentant rejection. The Gospel of John notes that **some Jewish leaders secretly believed in Jesus but refused to confess it** because they feared the Pharisees: *<span style="color:red">Among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but **because of the Pharisees they did not confess him**, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: **For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God**.</span>* (John 12:42-43, KJV) ([John 12:42-48 KJV - Nevertheless among the chief rulers - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2012%3A42-48&version=KJV#:~:text=42%C2%A0Nevertheless%20among%20the%20chief%20rulers,put%20out%20of%20the%20synagogue)) ([John 12:42-48 KJV - Nevertheless among the chief rulers - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2012%3A42-48&version=KJV#:~:text=43%C2%A0For%20they%20loved%20the%20praise,than%20the%20praise%20of%20God)). These authorities cared more for human approval and thus **shrank from openly following Christ**, effectively denying Him. They illustrate the tragic choice Jesus warns against. By contrast, those who boldly confessed Christ â€“ like Stephen, who proclaimed Jesus even while being stoned â€“ were owned by Christ before the Father and received into glory (Acts 7:55-56). Jesusâ€™s warning urges us to **be like Stephen, not like those fearful rulers**: to value Godâ€™s approval above manâ€™s and never disown our Lord.

## Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit â€“ Unforgivable Warning (Matthew 12:31-32)

**Context:**  
- This warning was given after a specific confrontation with the Pharisees. Jesus had just healed a demon-possessed blind mute man â€“ a stunning miracle that had the crowds wondering if Jesus might be the Son of David (Messiah) (Matthew 12:22-23).  
- In response, the Pharisees **scoffed that Jesus cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub (Satan)** (Matthew 12:24). They deliberately attributed the work of Godâ€™s Holy Spirit to the devil.  
- Jesus rebuked their illogic (saying a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand) and warned them that such words were extremely dangerous. He spoke of **blasphemy against the Holy Spirit** in this context â€“ a sin that will not be forgiven.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: **but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven** unto men**.</span> (Matthew 12:31, KJV)

**Meaning:** This is one of Jesusâ€™s most solemn warnings. **<span style="color:red">Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit</span>** specifically refers to the willful, malicious rejection of Godâ€™s Spirit at work â€“ in this case, the Pharisees were **labeling the Holy Spiritâ€™s work as demonic**. Jesus emphasizes that while Godâ€™s grace can cover a multitude of sins, **persistently attributing the Spiritâ€™s work to Satan (or persistently resisting the Spiritâ€™s conviction) is an unpardonable posture**. Itâ€™s essentially a hardened state of unbelief that refuses the very Agent (the Holy Spirit) by which we are brought to repentance and faith. By saying this sin <span style="color:red">shall not be forgiven,</span> Jesus underscores the eternal consequence: someone who **knowingly and persistently calls Godâ€™s goodness â€˜evilâ€™** is cutting themselves off from forgiveness, because they reject the Holy Spirit who enables repentance. In verse 32, He adds that speaking against the Son can be forgiven, but speaking against the Spirit will not â€“ indicating the unique seriousness of slandering the Spirit of God. In short, Jesus warns the Pharisees (and us) that there is **no salvation for a heart that decisively and persistently rejects the Holy Spirit**, for one dies in that state of hardened unbelief.

**Example in Scripture:** The Pharisees in this encounter are themselves an example â€“ they were **standing in the presence of the Holy Spiritâ€™s power**, seeing irrefutable miracles of goodness, yet accusing Jesus of sorcery. Their hearts were on the brink of the unforgivable. A comparable cautionary example is **Ananias and Sapphira** in the early church (Acts 5:1-11). While not exactly <span style="color:red">blaspheming the Spirit</span> in words, they **lied to the Holy Spirit** by attempting to deceive the apostles about their giving. Peter said to Ananias, *<span style="color:red">Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost? â€¦ **thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God**.</span>* (Acts 5:3-4, KJV) ([Acts 5:3-4 KJV - But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205%3A3-4&version=KJV#:~:text=Acts%205%3A3,Read%20full%20chapter)). The result was immediate judgment: both Ananias and his wife fell down dead after their lie was exposed ([Acts 5:4 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Acts-5-4/#:~:text=thou%20hast%20not%20lied%20unto,them%20that%20heard%20these)). This story highlights how **seriously God takes offenses against His Spirit**. Itâ€™s not identical to the Phariseesâ€™ slander, but it shows that to **willfully test or insult the Spirit of the Lord is deadly** (Acts 5:9-10). Ananias and Sapphiraâ€™s fate caused <span style="color:red">great fear</span> to come on the church, reinforcing Jesusâ€™s grave warning: we must **reverence the Holy Spirit** and respond to His work, not scorn or lie to Him.

## Woe to Unrepentant Cities (Matthew 11:20-24)

**Context:**  
- In His Galilean ministry, Jesus performed many mighty miracles in certain towns. However, the people in those towns largely **refused to repent** and recognize Him as Messiah. Matthew notes that Jesus began to denounce (upbraid) the cities **<span style="color:red">wherein most of His mighty works were done, because they repented not.</span>** (Matthew 11:20).  
- Just prior to this, Jesus spoke of the obstinate attitude of His generation â€“ likening them to children who are never satisfied (Matthew 11:16-19). This set the stage for His stern **<span style="color:red">woes</span>** upon specific towns.  
- Jesus then **called out Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum by name**, comparing them unfavorably to notoriously sinful Gentile cities. 

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida!** for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long agoâ€¦. **But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you**.</span> (Matthew 11:21-22, KJV)

*(Jesus continued, pronouncing a similar woe on Capernaum, saying it would be thrust down to hell and that even Sodom would fare better in judgment than that unrepentant city â€“ see Matthew 11:23-24.)*

**Meaning:** <span style="color:red">Woe</span> is an exclamation of grief and doom. Jesus is declaring that these Jewish cities, which **saw His miracles firsthand and still refused to repent**, were headed for severe judgment. He shocks His listeners by saying that **pagan cities like Tyre, Sidon, and even Sodom** â€“ known for their wickedness â€“ would have responded better had they seen what Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum saw. Therefore, on Judgment Day, the punishment for those Gentile cities will be *more bearable* than for the Galilean towns, because **greater light rejected brings greater condemnation**. This warning teaches that privilege entails responsibility: those who personally encounter Jesusâ€™s power and message are accountable to respond. The unrepentant cities had **no excuse**, and thus their judgment would be even more extreme than that of notoriously sinful cities. In essence, Jesus warns that **willful unbelief in the face of great evidence is a soul-condemning stance**. The mention of judgment day and hell (<span style="color:red">brought down to hell</span> for Capernaum) makes clear that eternal consequences await those who see the work of Christ and yet harden their hearts.

**Example in Scripture:** The fate of **Sodom** illustrates the kind of judgment Jesus invokes. Sodom was infamous for its sin and **perished under fiery judgment**. *<span style="color:red">Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fireâ€¦ And He overthrew those cities</span>* (Genesis 19:24-25, KJV) ([Genesis 19:24-25 KJV - Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019%3A24-25&version=KJV#:~:text=and%20www,and%20all%20the%20plain%2C)). Sodomâ€™s destruction was total â€“ an everlasting example of Godâ€™s wrath on unrepentant wickedness. Yet Jesus said **even Sodom** would find the Day of Judgment <span style="color:red">more tolerable</span> than Capernaum (Matthew 11:24). Why? Because Sodom never witnessed Jesusâ€™s miracles and hear His call to repent as Capernaum did. Capernaumâ€™s greater knowledge meant greater accountability. Indeed, within a generation of Jesusâ€™s warning, those Galilean towns faced devastation (they eventually fell into ruin), foreshadowing the ultimate judgment. The warning to <span style="color:red">woe</span> is thus sobering: **if we persistently reject Christâ€™s call to repentance, we court the same doom that befell Sodom** â€“ or worse, for having spurned even greater mercy. The people of **Noahâ€™s generation** likewise ignored repeated warnings and <span style="color:red">knew not until the flood came and took them all away</span> (Matthew 24:39). They all perished in the Flood because they refused to repent, just as Jesus warns will happen to any who, despite Godâ€™s clear revelation, **refuse to turn from their sin**.

## Except Ye Repent, Ye Shall All Likewise Perish (Luke 13:35)

**Context:**  
- Some people told Jesus about a recent atrocity: **Pilate had killed some Galilean worshipers** and mingled their blood with their sacrifices (Luke 13:1). This news event raised the age-old question of whether those victims were extraordinarily sinful to suffer such a fate.  
- Jesus understood their implicit question and responded by correcting their thinking. He asked, <span style="color:red">Do you suppose those Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered thus?</span> (Luke 13:2). He answered, <span style="color:red">No.</span>  
- Then, **Jesus broadened the warning to everyone** listening. He twice declared that without repentance, **all would likewise perish** â€“ first referencing the Galileans, and then adding a second example of a tragedy: the collapse of the tower of Siloam that killed 18 people (Luke 13:4-5).

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish**.</span> (Luke 13:3, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus shifts the focus from speculating about othersâ€™ sins to examining our own hearts. He makes it clear that those Galileans who were murdered were not extraordinarily evil â€“ **everyone is a sinner in need of repentance**. The phrase <span style="color:red">likewise perish</span> doesnâ€™t necessarily mean perish in the same *manner* (by violence or accident), but rather to **face ruin and death** under Godâ€™s judgment. In other words, Jesus warns that unless we turn from our sins (which is what <span style="color:red">repent</span> means: to have a change of mind and heart leading to a change of life), we will all face **destruction** â€“ ultimately eternal death. Itâ€™s a universal call: *<span style="color:red">all</span>* need repentance. The brevity of the warning belies its urgency. Any day, tragedy could strike (<span style="color:red">perish</span> in a calamity) or oneâ€™s life could end and they would face God. Therefore, **now is the time to repent**. Jesus effectively says: *Donâ€™t assume youâ€™re morally safe because you havenâ€™t suffered â€“ instead, recognize that you, too, need to repent or you will meet a disastrous end.* The inclusion of the tower of Siloam accident (a natural tragedy) reinforces that **death can come unexpectedly to anyone**, so repentance is urgent for everyone.

**Example in Scripture:** The story of **Noahâ€™s generation** powerfully underscores this warning. Noah preached righteousness to a corrupt world (implicitly calling them to repent) while he built the ark, but the people **ignored the warning**. When the Flood came, *<span style="color:red">all flesh died that moved upon the earth</span>* (Genesis 7:21, KJV) ([Genesis 7:21 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-7-21/#:~:text=Genesis%207%3A21%20KJV%3A%20And%20all,thing%20that%20creepeth%20upon)) â€“ everyone outside the ark perished. Those people **<span style="color:red">were eating, drinking, marrying</span>** and carrying on as usual, unwilling to repent, *<span style="color:red">until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all</span>* (Luke 17:27). They <span style="color:red">likewise perished</span> because they did not heed the call to turn from their violence and evil (Genesis 6:5-7). Jesus specifically draws a parallel to Noahâ€™s day elsewhere, warning that as it was then, so it will be when judgment comes suddenly upon the unrepentant. Another example: the **city of Nineveh** in Jonahâ€™s time initially was slated for destruction, but when Jonah finally preached, the Ninevites repented in sackcloth and fasting, and God mercifully spared them (Jonah 3:4-10). Jesus even mentioned that the men of Nineveh, who *did* repent, will rise up and condemn Jesusâ€™s generation that *did not* (Matthew 12:41). The point is clear: **only repentance leads to life**. If we refuse to repent â€“ like those in Noahâ€™s generation or like those Galileans and Jerusalemites of Jesusâ€™s day who hardened their hearts â€“ we will certainly perish in our sins. Jesusâ€™s warning is both an ultimatum and an invitation: *Turn from sin and live, or continue in sin and perish.* There is no middle ground.

## Woe to Those Who Cause Others to Stumble (Matthew 18:6-7)

**Context:**  
- The disciples came to Jesus asking, <span style="color:red">Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</span> (Matthew 18:1). In response, Jesus brought a little child into their midst and taught that one must become humble like a child to enter Godâ€™s kingdom, and that whoever welcomes a child in Jesusâ€™s name welcomes Him (Matthew 18:2-5).  
- Still holding up the child as an example, Jesus shifted to a **stern warning about how believers (often termed <span style="color:red">little ones</span>) are treated**. Having emphasized caring for the humble and lowly, He now warns of the judgment on anyone who would **lead such believers into sin**.  
- Jesus pronounces <span style="color:red">woe</span> and uses graphic imagery (a millstone drowning) to stress how serious it is to **cause another person to stumble in faith or fall into sin**.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me**, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. **Woe unto the world because of offences!** â€¦ **but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh**!</span> (Matthew 18:6-7, KJV)

**Meaning:** In this context, <span style="color:red">offend</span> means to **cause to stumble** or sin. <span style="color:red">These little ones</span> refers not only to children but by extension to humble believers who trust in Jesus with a childlike faith. Jesus issues a chilling warning: if anyone **leads a believer into sin or causes them to fall away**, that person will face dreadful consequences â€“ *<span style="color:red">woe to that man</span>*. The imagery of a heavy millstone (a massive stone for grinding grain) tied to oneâ€™s neck and being cast into the sea indicates that **it would be better to die a horrible death now** than to face the judgment God has in store for someone who corrupts or harms the faith of an innocent. Jesus acknowledges that <span style="color:red">offenses</span> (temptations to sin, enticements, or traps) will happen in this fallen world, but He places personal responsibility on the offender: *<span style="color:red">but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh.</span>* In other words, **God will hold us accountable for how our actions affect othersâ€™ souls**. This warning elevates the seriousness of our example and teaching. Particularly, it targets spiritual pride or abuse â€“ those who, like the Pharisees, might make it harder for others to enter the kingdom (cf. Matthew 23:13). The <span style="color:red">woe</span> signifies impending judgment: *do not be the cause of anotherâ€™s spiritual downfall*, or you will incur Godâ€™s wrath.

**Example in Scripture:** A stark example of causing many to stumble is **King Jeroboam of Israel**. Jeroboam led an entire nation into idolatry by setting up golden calves and a false religion in Israel (1 Kings 12:28-30). The Bible repeatedly notes that Jeroboam *<span style="color:red">made Israel to sin</span>*. He **enticed the people away from God**, and as a result, God pronounced disaster on Jeroboamâ€™s lineage. The prophet Ahijah told Jeroboamâ€™s wife, *<span style="color:red">I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboamâ€¦ and will cut off from Jeroboam every male</span>* (1 Kings 14:10). God also said *<span style="color:red">He shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, **who did sin, and who made Israel to sin**.</span>* (1 Kings 14:16, KJV). Indeed, Jeroboamâ€™s dynasty was utterly destroyed (1 Kings 15:29). Jeroboam illustrates <span style="color:red">that man by whom the offence cometh</span> â€“ his actions introduced idolatrous offenses, and **woe came upon him and his house**. Likewise, in the New Testament, Jesus pointed to the **Pharisees** as causing others to stumble: *<span style="color:red">Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, **ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves**.</span>* (Matthew 23:15, KJV) ([Matthew 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng#:~:text=platter%2C%20that%20the%20outside%20of,them%20may%20be%20clean%20also)). Their hypocritical teaching corrupted their converts. Jesus reserved some of His harshest words (<span style="color:red">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees!</span>) for this reason. Both Jeroboam and the Pharisees serve as warnings that **leading others into sin multiplies oneâ€™s guilt**. On the positive side, Jesus said itâ€™s better to cut off oneâ€™s hand than to cause oneself or others to sin â€“ showing how extreme we must be in avoiding this. The millstone metaphor and these examples should instill a godly fear in us: we must **never become a stumbling block** to others. Instead, weâ€™re called to encourage others toward righteousness, not entice them into sin.

## Remove Whatever Causes You to Sin (to Avoid Hell) (Mark 9:43-48)

**Context:**  
- Directly after warning about causing <span style="color:red">little ones</span> to stumble, Jesus shifted to the personal side: **each person must also deal drastically with their own sin** (Mark 9:42-43). In Markâ€™s Gospel, this teaching comes after the disciples had been arguing about greatness and John mentioned someone casting out demons in Jesusâ€™s name (Mark 9:34-38). Jesus first taught about not causing others to stumble (Mark 9:42), then immediately about not stumbling oneself.  
- He used startling hyperbole â€“ cutting off a hand or foot, plucking out an eye â€“ to drive home the necessity of **ruthless self-discipline** in the fight against sin (Mark 9:43-48; also Matthew 18:8-9 in the same discourse as the <span style="color:red">little ones</span> warning).

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell,** into the fire that never shall be quenched.</span> (Mark 9:43, KJV)

*(Jesus continues similarly: if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off; if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out â€“ better to enter life lame or one-eyed than for your whole body to be cast into hellfire (Mark 9:44-48).)*

**Meaning:** Jesus is not advocating physical mutilation; rather, this is hyperbole to emphasize how critically we must **sever ourselves from whatever leads us into sin**. <span style="color:red">If your hand (or foot or eye) causes you to sin</span> â€“ meaning if something as precious to you as a hand is dragging you into wrongdoing â€“ **get rid of it**! The stark comparison is **eternal life vs. eternal death** (<span style="color:red">hellâ€¦fire that never shall be quenched</span>). Sin, unchecked, puts one on the path to hell. Therefore, *any sacrifice is worth avoiding sin*. This warning tells us to take personal holiness deadly seriously. We must <span style="color:red">cut off</span> the sources of temptation â€“ whether it be a habit, a relationship, an activity, or anything else â€“ if it threatens our soul. Jesus highlights the **horrors of hell** (unquenchable fire, undying worm per Mark 9:48) to jolt us into realizing that *no pleasure or gain from sin is worth the price of eternal loss*. In summary, **deal radically with sin now, or face the far worse consequence of judgment later**. Itâ€™s better to limp into heaven having denied yourself some desires, than to stroll into hell indulging every desire. This warning calls for **urgent, decisive repentance and self-denial** in the battle against sin.

**Example in Scripture:** One biblical example of someone who **failed to <span style="color:red">cut off</span> the sin in his life** is **Judas Iscariot**. Judas had a persistent sin issue â€“ **greed** â€“ that he never truly repented of. He was in charge of the money bag for Jesusâ€™s group and *<span style="color:red">was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein</span>* (John 12:6, KJV) ([John 12:6 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-12-6/#:~:text=John%2012%3A6%20,%E2%80%9D%20King%20James%20Version%20%28KJV)). Rather than confess and cut off this love of money, Judas allowed it to grow. Eventually, for 30 pieces of silver, he betrayed Jesus to the chief priests. His unchecked sin led to **disastrous consequences**: overwhelmed by remorse, Judas ended up hanging himself (*<span style="color:red">heâ€¦went and hanged himself</span>* Matthew 27:5, KJV) ([Matthew 27:5 KJV - King James Version - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A5&version=KJV#:~:text=And%20he%20cast%20down%20the,27%3A5%20in%20all%20English%20translations)). Jesus had said of him, <span style="color:red">woe to that man</span> (as we saw earlier), and indeed Judas died tragically and is remembered infamously. The **<span style="color:red">worse thing</span>** came upon him â€“ he lost apostleship and part in the ministry, and Acts 1:25 says Judas went <span style="color:red">to his own place,</span> implying perdition. In contrast, consider someone like **Joseph** in Genesis, who when tempted sexually by Potipharâ€™s wife, **fled and refused to sin** (Genesis 39:12). Joseph <span style="color:red">cut off</span> the opportunity for adultery by literally running away, even though it landed him in prison unjustly â€“ better to lose his cloak and freedom than lose his integrity. Josephâ€™s story affirms Jesusâ€™s warning in a positive light: heâ€™d rather suffer loss than offend God. Judas, however, clung to sin and <span style="color:red">fullness</span> of his desires, which led to emptiness and destruction. Jesusâ€™s call is clear: **eliminate the bait of sin** in your life decisively. No earthly attachment is worth dragging into hell. As Hebrews 12:1 urges, <span style="color:red">lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us.</span> Itâ€™s a hard saying, but itâ€™s actually grace â€“ Jesus is urging us to **repent radically now, so we inherit life, not hell**.

---

## Forgive Others, or You Will Not Be Forgiven (Matthew 6:14-15)

**Context:**  
- In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught His disciples how to pray in what is commonly called the Lordâ€™s Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13). One petition in that model prayer is, <span style="color:red">Forgive us our debts, **as we forgive our debtors**</span> (Matthew 6:12).  
- Immediately after concluding the prayer, Jesus **singled out the forgiveness petition for special emphasis**. He expounded in plain terms that our Fatherâ€™s forgiveness of us is directly linked to our willingness to forgive others (Matthew 6:14-15).  
- This warning, therefore, comes in the context of daily prayer and piety. It underscores a condition of Godâ€™s forgiveness that the disciples might otherwise overlook.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses**.</span> (Matthew 6:15, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus is teaching that **receiving forgiveness from God is inseparable from extending forgiveness to others**. He states it in the negative for impact: if we stubbornly refuse to forgive those who have wronged us, we forfeit our own forgiveness from God. This doesnâ€™t mean we earn Godâ€™s forgiveness by forgiving others (Godâ€™s grace is unearned), but it means that a **forgiven heart must be a forgiving heart**. If we harbor bitterness and an unforgiving spirit, it reveals we havenâ€™t truly grasped or accepted Godâ€™s mercy for ourselves. Jesus essentially warns, <span style="color:red">Donâ€™t expect God to wash away your sins if you insist on holding othersâ€™ sins against them.</span> It is a strong incentive to examine our relationships and clear any grudges. This principle is so important that Jesus later illustrated it with a whole parable (the Unforgiving Servant in Matthew 18:23-35). In that story, a servant forgiven an enormous debt refuses to forgive a small debt owed to him â€“ and his master ends up revoking the pardon and delivering him to punishment. Jesus then reiterates, <span style="color:red">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses</span> (Matthew 18:35, KJV) ([Matthew 18:23-35 - King James Version - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A23-35&version=KJV#:~:text=And%20his%20lord%20was%20wroth%2C,heavenly%20Father%20do%20also)) ([Matthew 18 (KJV) - Bible Society](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/kjv/Matt/18/#:~:text=Matthew%2018%20%28KJV%29%20,heavenly%20Father%20do%20also)). The meaning of the warning is crystal clear: **forgive others if you expect to be forgiven by God**. An unforgiving Christian is an oxymoron, and such a person puts themselves under Godâ€™s displeasure.

**Example in Scripture:** Jesusâ€™s **Parable of the Unforgiving Servant** (Matthew 18:23-35) provides the clearest example. In the parable, a king forgave one of his servants an astronomically large debt (ten thousand talents). But that servant went out and **found a fellow servant who owed him a tiny sum**, grabbed him by the throat, and demanded payment. The debtor begged for mercy, but the forgiven servant **refused to forgive** and threw the man into prison. When the king learned of this, he was furious. He revoked his mercy and said to the unforgiving servant: *<span style="color:red">O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt... **shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant**...?</span>* (Matthew 18:32-33). In wrath, the king **delivered him to the tormentors until he paid all he owed** (which, being a huge debt, implied a never-ending punishment) ([Matthew 18:23-35 - King James Version - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A23-35&version=KJV#:~:text=And%20his%20lord%20was%20wroth%2C,heavenly%20Father%20do%20also)). Jesus then delivers the moral: *<span style="color:red">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</span>* (Matthew 18:35) ([Matthew 18 (KJV) - Bible Society](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/kjv/Matt/18/#:~:text=Matthew%2018%20%28KJV%29%20,heavenly%20Father%20do%20also)). This parable is essentially an expanded illustration of the warning in Matthew 6:15. And it played out in real life as well: **Josephâ€™s brothers** feared Joseph might not forgive them for the evil they did to him. If Joseph had harbored a grudge, he could have punished them severely after their father died. But Joseph forgave them from the heart, saying, <span style="color:red">Fear notâ€¦ you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good</span> (Genesis 50:19-20). Josephâ€™s forgiveness led to reconciliation and life. By contrast, an unforgiving attitude leads to spiritual imprisonment. The servant in the parable was **shown no mercy because he showed no mercy**. This echoes James 2:13: <span style="color:red">He shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy.</span> Thus, Jesusâ€™s warning is both a threat and a plea: *donâ€™t cut yourself off from Godâ€™s mercy by refusing to give mercy*. **Extend to others the same forgiveness God graciously extended to you**, or you will face the torment of a debt unforgiven.

## Judge Not, That Ye Be Not Judged (Matthew 7:1-2)

**Context:**  
- Earlier in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus had addressed hypocritical behaviors (such as ostentatious prayer and fasting in Matthew 6). Now, in Matthew 7, He turns to **interpersonal relationships among His followers**.  
- Having just taught about trusting God over worrying (Matthew 6:25-34), Jesus proceeds to teach how we view and treat othersâ€™ faults. Matthew 7:1 opens a new section of the sermon dealing with a critical attitude.  
- The verses immediately after (Matthew 7:3-5) speak of noticing a speck in your brotherâ€™s eye while a plank is in your own â€“ vividly illustrating the hypocrisy of harsh judgment. Thus, the warning <span style="color:red">judge not</span> is set in the context of **personal interactions and self-examination**.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Judge not, that ye be not judged.** For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span> (Matthew 7:1-2, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus is warning against a **critical, condemning spirit**. <span style="color:red">Judge not</span> does not mean we abandon discernment or call evil good; rather, it means we must not assume the role of harsh judge over others, **passing sentence on them as if we ourselves were not subject to judgment**. The warning carries a reciprocal principle: the standard we apply to others is the standard that will be applied to us. In other words, if we are merciful and gracious, we will receive mercy; but if we are unmerciful, hypercritical, and quick to condemn, we invite a similarly strict judgment on ourselves (both from God and often from others as well). *<span style="color:red">Measure for measure</span>* is the idea. Jesus immediately calls out the hypocrisy of noticing the *<span style="color:red">mote</span>* (speck) in someone elseâ€™s eye while ignoring the *<span style="color:red">beam</span>* (log) in oneâ€™s own (Matthew 7:3-5). The implication is that **we tend to magnify othersâ€™ faults and minimize our own**, and Jesus says God will flip that on us if we do so. This warning encourages humility: before you critique someone, examine yourself. If we obey <span style="color:red">judge not</span> in the way Jesus intends, we become slower to condemn, quicker to empathize and forgive. The result is that **we will not fall under condemnation ourselves**. In summary, **do not judge unfairly or self-righteously, or you will face the same scrutiny** â€“ especially from the all-knowing God.

**Example in Scripture:** King **Davidâ€™s reaction to Nathanâ€™s parable** is an excellent illustration of this principle. When the prophet Nathan told David a story about a rich man who stole a poor manâ€™s beloved little lamb, David was indignant and **passed a harsh judgment**: <span style="color:red">The man that hath done this thing shall surely die, and he shall restore the lamb fourfold!</span> (2 Samuel 12:5-6). David had unknowingly **judged himself** â€“ for the parable was a veiled indictment of Davidâ€™s own sin with Bathsheba (taking Uriahâ€™s wife and effectively causing Uriahâ€™s death). Nathan famously replied to David, *<span style="color:red">Thou art the man!</span>* and then pronounced Godâ€™s judgment: *<span style="color:red">Now therefore **the sword shall never depart from thine house**; because thou hast despised Meâ€¦</span>* (2 Samuel 12:7, 10, KJV) ([2 Samuel 12:7-23 KJV - And Nathan said to David, Thou art the](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2012%3A7-23&version=KJV#:~:text=the%20www,thine%20house%3B%20because%20thou)) ([2 Samuel 12:7-15 KJV - Bible.com](https://www.bible.com/bible/1/2SA.12.7-15.KJV#:~:text=2%20Samuel%2012%3A7,thine%20house%3B%20because%20thou)). David had said the thief should pay back fourfold, and indeed David later **lost four of his sons** in tragic ways (the baby with Bathsheba, Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah) â€“ a fourfold sorrow. He also lived the rest of his days with violence (<span style="color:red">the sword</span>) and turmoil in his household as Nathan prophesied. David experienced the very principle Jesus articulated: *with the measure he measured, it was measured back to him*. He judged another severely and came under severe judgment. On the other hand, consider Jesusâ€™s handling of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:3-11). The Pharisees were eager to stone her, effectively judging her worthy of death while ignoring their own sins. Jesus confronted them, *<span style="color:red">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span>* (John 8:7). **Convicted by their consciences**, they all left. Jesus â€“ the one person truly without sin â€“ did not condemn the woman but rather forgave her and urged her to sin no more. The Pharisees in that scenario were like a living example of the beam and speck: in condemning the woman, they were condemning themselves. Jesusâ€™s warning <span style="color:red">judge not</span> calls us to drop the stones of condemnation. If we donâ€™t, we may find those **stones hurled back at us**. Thus, we should adopt an attitude of mercy and humility, as **<span style="color:red">judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy</span>** (James 2:13). By refraining from unrighteous judgment, we leave ultimate judgment to God and avoid bringing judgment upon ourselves.

## Woe to Hypocritical Religious Leaders (Matthew 23:13-33)

**Context:**  
- In the week before His crucifixion, Jesus delivered a scathing series of <span style="color:red">woes</span> against the scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 23). This took place in the Temple, in the hearing of the crowds and His disciples (Matthew 23:1). Jesus had just warned the people not to imitate the Phariseesâ€™ showy religion (Matthew 23:3-7) and taught that true greatness comes from humility (Matthew 23:11-12).  
- Then, turning specifically to the **religious leaders**, Jesus pronounced seven (or eight) **woes** â€“ prophetic condemnations â€“ listing their egregious sins: shutting people out of the kingdom, greed, hypocrisy, obsessing over minor rules while neglecting justice and mercy, outward cleanliness with inward corruption, and persecuting Godâ€™s messengers.  
- This is a **comprehensive warning to those in spiritual authority** who are hypocrites. Each <span style="color:red">woe</span> follows a pattern: <span style="color:red">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you do Xâ€¦</span> culminating in a declaration of judgment.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** *<span style="color:red">Woe unto you, **scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!** for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead menâ€™s bonesâ€¦ Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, **but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity**.</span>* (Matthew 23:27-28, KJV) ([Matthew 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng#:~:text=platter%2C%20that%20the%20outside%20of,them%20may%20be%20clean%20also))

*(And: <span style="color:red">Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, **how can ye escape the damnation of hell?**</span> â€“ Matthew 23:33.)*

**Meaning:** In these woes, Jesus is effectively pronouncing that **judgment is coming upon the religious establishment** because of their persistent hypocrisy and wickedness. Each woe highlights a different facet of their corruption (e.g., v13 â€“ they shut others out of Godâ€™s kingdom; v14 â€“ they exploit widows; v15 â€“ their converts become even more evil; v23 â€“ they tithe mint but neglect mercy and justice; v25-26 â€“ they clean the outside but are filthy inside; v27-28 â€“ like whitewashed tombs; v29-32 â€“ they honor prophetsâ€™ tombs but are heirs of those who murdered the prophets). The repeated **<span style="color:red">hypocrites!</span>** drives home that their religion is an act â€“ external show without internal truth. <span style="color:red">Woe</span> signifies great sorrow or disaster upon them. Indeed, Jesus explicitly asks how they will escape **hell** given their behavior (v33). This is a warning that **high religious standing does not exempt one from Godâ€™s wrath if oneâ€™s heart is corrupt**. In fact, it incurs greater guilt. These leaders knew the Scriptures and pretended piety, but secretly broke Godâ€™s laws and rejected His Messiah. Thus, Jesus warns that **their doom is certain** (<span style="color:red">the damnation of hell</span>). The imagery of whitewashed tombs is powerful: they made themselves look pure and holy on the outside (like a tomb painted white), but inside they were spiritually dead and foul. This warning is a sobering lesson that God sees the heart â€“ **no amount of outward religiosity can fool Him**. Those who lead others in faith must themselves be faithful, or else face woes. The <span style="color:red">woes</span> in Matthew 23 essentially predict the downfall of these hypocrites (and indeed, within that generation Jerusalem and the Temple were destroyed in A.D. 70, which can be seen as a partial fulfillment of this judgment). For us today, the warning endures: **God will severely judge religious hypocrisy**, especially in leaders who shut people out of the kingdom and misrepresent God.

**Example in Scripture:** The fate of those Pharisees and Jerusalemâ€™s leaders came to fruition historically â€“ within about 40 years of Jesusâ€™s pronouncement, Jerusalem was besieged and the Temple burned by the Romans (in 70 A.D.), a catastrophe that left no stone upon another (as Jesus had prophesied in Matthew 24:2). According to the New Testament, many of those religious leaders also faced personal judgment: **Ananias the high priest** was known for corruption and met a brutal death at the hands of his own zealot countrymen during the Jewish revolt. But an even clearer biblical example of religious hypocrisy judged by God is found earlier in Israelâ€™s history with **the sons of Eli (Hophni and Phinehas)**. They were priests who profaned the sacrificial system â€“ they took by force the best meat from worshipers and slept with the women serving at the Tabernacle (1 Samuel 2:12-17,22). They had the **outward role of spiritual leaders** but lived in flagrant sin. God declared that their sins would not be atoned for and that both would die on the same day (1 Samuel 2:34). This came to pass when the Philistines defeated Israel: *<span style="color:red">the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain</span>* (1 Samuel 4:11 ([1 Samuel 4:11 KJV - And the ark of God was taken - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%204%3A11&version=KJV#:~:text=Gateway%20www,4%3A11%20in%20all%20English%20translations))). Furthermore, Eliâ€™s house lost the priesthood. This mirrors the fate Jesus warned of: hypocritical ministers of God **fell under Godâ€™s woe**. In the New Testament, another example is **Ananias and Sapphira** (Acts 5 again) â€“ they pretended to donate all the proceeds of a sale while secretly holding back some money. They wanted the **appearance** of extreme generosity and holiness, but it was a lie. When Peter, by the Holy Spirit, exposed their deception, **both fell down dead** on the spot (Acts 5:5,10). Great fear seized the church, as it was evident that **God will not be mocked**. These examples reinforce Jesusâ€™s thunderous warning in Matthew 23: God utterly condemns religious hypocrisy. The <span style="color:red">woes</span> tell us that **hell is real for hypocrites** unless they repent. No position, title, or outward show can save someone whose faith is fake. Thus, Jesusâ€™s warning to the scribes and Pharisees stands for all time: *examine your heart, remove the mask, or face the woe of Godâ€™s judgment.*

## Woe to the Betrayer (Judas Iscariot) (Matthew 26:24)

**Context:**  
- During the Last Supper on the night of His arrest, Jesus announced that **one of the Twelve would betray Him** (Matthew 26:21). The disciples were very sorrowful and each began to ask, <span style="color:red">Lord, is it I?</span> (26:22).  
- Jesus confirmed the betrayer was one who dipped his hand in the dish with Him, and indeed Judas was present and participating in the meal (Matthew 26:23).  
- At that pivotal moment, Jesus delivered a grave <span style="color:red">woe</span> directed at the betrayer, **without naming Judas openly**. This served as both a prophetic condemnation and a final warning to Judas.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but **woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!** it had been good for that man if he had not been born**.</span> (Matthew 26:24, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus acknowledges that His betrayal and death (<span style="color:red">the Son of man goeth</span>) is part of Godâ€™s foreordained plan (<span style="color:red">as it is written</span>). However, that does not exonerate the one who carries out the betrayal. <span style="color:red">Woe unto that man</span> indicates **dire judgment and misery** for the betrayer. The statement *<span style="color:red">it would be good for that man if he had not been born</span>* is one of the most chilling expressions in Scripture â€“ it implies that the fate awaiting Judas is so awful that non-existence would be preferable. This strongly alludes to **eternal damnation** (for what temporal punishment could be worse than never having been born?). In effect, Jesus declares that **betraying the Messiah â€“ the most innocent and loving one â€“ is such a heinous act that it will incur the severest judgment from God**. Despite walking with Jesus for years and hearing His teachings, Judasâ€™s treachery places him under a woe. The warning also highlights personal responsibility: Godâ€™s plan would be fulfilled, but Judas freely chose to be the betrayer, and thus he is accountable. For Judas, and anyone who would willfully reject and <span style="color:red">betray</span> Christ, the implication is that **the consequences are eternally tragic**. It is a final poignant attempt by Jesus to confront Judas (who was likely present and understood the reference) with the horror of what he was about to do â€“ perhaps to shock him into abandoning the plot. Sadly, Judas did not turn back.

**Example in Scripture:** **Judas Iscariot** himself is the sobering example. Despite Jesusâ€™s warning at the supper, Judas went through with the betrayal. He left the meal (John 13:27-30) and led a band of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, identifying Jesus with a kiss. The guilt of his deed soon overwhelmed him. Matthew 27:3-5 recounts that Judas, seeing Jesus condemned, was **seized with remorse**. He declared, <span style="color:red">I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood,</span> and flung the thirty pieces of silver into the temple. But it was too late â€“ the deed was done. In despair, *<span style="color:red">he went and **hanged himself**.</span>* (Matthew 27:5, KJV) ([Matthew 27:5 KJV - King James Version - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027%3A5&version=KJV#:~:text=And%20he%20cast%20down%20the,27%3A5%20in%20all%20English%20translations)). This tragic end illustrates Jesusâ€™s words vividly: Judas experienced such anguish that he took his own life, and beyond that, Scripture implies he went to a dreadful fate. In Acts 1:18-20, itâ€™s noted that Judasâ€™s body fell and burst open, and that the Field of Blood was named after his grim death â€“ a field acquired with the betrayal money. Peter also said that Judas *<span style="color:red">by transgression fell, that he might go **to his own place**</span>* (Acts 1:25), a euphemism understood by many commentators as meaning Judas went to hell or a state of perdition reserved for him. Jesus had called Judas <span style="color:red">the son of perdition</span> (John 17:12). Indeed, *woe to that man*. Judasâ€™s life serves as a dire warning: one can be close to Jesus in proximity, and yet **fall away** and come under woe by rejecting Him. **No betrayal of Christ goes unnoticed by God**. In betraying the Lord of Life, Judas sealed his own doom â€“ fulfilling Jesusâ€™s very words that it would have been better for him never to have been born. The **woe of Judas** stands throughout ages as a warning of the spiritual ruin that comes from utterly turning oneâ€™s back on Jesus.

## Stay Alert: Be Ready for Christâ€™s Return (Matthew 24:42-44)

**Context:**  
- In the Olivet Discourse about the end of the age, after describing various signs and tribulations, Jesus emphasized the **unknown timing** of His Second Coming. <span style="color:red">Of that day and hour knoweth no manâ€¦ but my Father only</span> (Matthew 24:36). He compared the suddenness of His coming to the days of Noah when people were caught unaware by the Flood (Matthew 24:37-39).  
- Jesus then gave a series of exhortations and analogies about readiness. He used the image of a thief coming in the night â€“ if the master of the house knew when, heâ€™d watch, but since he doesnâ€™t, he must be always watchful (Matthew 24:43).  
- This leads to the central admonition for believers to **stay awake and prepared**, since Jesus will return at an hour we do not expect.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come**â€¦. **Be ye also ready**: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</span> (Matthew 24:42, 44 KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus commands **spiritual watchfulness**. <span style="color:red">Watch</span> means to stay awake, be vigilant, keep alert. The reason given is that we do not know exactly when Christ will return. The **uncertainty of the timing** is intentional â€“ God wants every generation of believers to live in a state of expectancy and moral readiness. <span style="color:red">Be ye also ready</span> reinforces that we are to **live in a prepared state**, not in indifference or procrastination. In practical terms, this means living in obedience, faith, and holiness consistently, so that whenever Jesus comes (or whenever we die and meet Him), we will be found faithful. Jesus immediately follows this with parables: the faithful and wise servant versus the evil servant (Matthew 24:45-51), the Wise and Foolish Virgins (Matthew 25:1-13), and the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30) â€“ all of which echo the theme of **readiness and being about the Masterâ€™s business**. The warning <span style="color:red">your Lord comes at an hour you do not expect</span> implies that **Christâ€™s return will be sudden** and possibly sooner than one thinks. Therefore, do not say <span style="color:red">my Lord delays</span> and slack off (Matthew 24:48-50). The consequences of being unprepared are severe â€“ Jesus describes the unready servant being cut apart and assigned a place with hypocrites (24:51), and the foolish virgins locked out of the wedding feast (Matthew 25:10-12). In sum, this warning calls for **constant vigilance** in our spiritual lives. Every day should be lived as if it might be the day of the Lordâ€™s return. This prevents complacency and motivates purity and mission.

**Example in Scripture:** Jesusâ€™s **Parable of the Ten Virgins** (Matthew 25:1-13) perfectly illustrates this warning. Ten maidens awaited a bridegroom at a wedding. **Five were wise** and brought extra oil for their lamps, staying prepared even when the bridegroom was delayed. The other **five were foolish** â€“ they brought no extra oil. When the call rang out at midnight that the bridegroom was coming, the wise virgins trimmed their lamps (they had oil) and were **ready to meet him**, but the foolish ones found their lamps going out. Desperate, the foolish virgins rushed to buy oil at the last minute. While they were gone, the bridegroom arrived and **<span style="color:red">they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and **the door was shut**.</span>* (Matthew 25:10, KJV) ([MATTHEW CHAPTER 25 KJV - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-Chapter-25/#:~:text=MATTHEW%20CHAPTER%2025%20KJV%20,11%20Afterward%20came%20also)). The five foolish virgins came later, pounding on the closed door, saying <span style="color:red">Lord, Lord, open to us.</span> But the bridegroom replied, <span style="color:red">Verily I say unto you, I know you not</span> (Matthew 25:11-12). Jesus ends the parable with the same admonition: *<span style="color:red">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span>* (Matthew 25:13). The **wise virgins** represent those who heed Jesusâ€™s warning â€“ they maintained a state of readiness (symbolized by the oil of preparedness) and therefore joined the celebration. The **foolish virgins** represent those who become lax and are unprepared when Christ comes â€“ they faced **irreversible exclusion** (the shut door). Another biblical example is the generation of **Noah**. Jesus directly likened the days before His return to Noahâ€™s days: people were absorbed in everyday life and **ignored Noahâ€™s warnings**. They <span style="color:red">knew not</span> until the flood came and **swept them all away** (Matthew 24:39). They were not ready, and they all perished. Conversely, Noah and his family, who **heeded Godâ€™s warning** and prepared the ark, were saved. Likewise, **Lot** and his family were warned to leave Sodom before judgment fell â€“ *only those who took the warning seriously escaped*. Jesus specifically said, <span style="color:red">Remember Lotâ€™s wife</span> as a caution (Luke 17:32) â€“ she looked back and was caught in the destruction because her heart was still in Sodom (more on that below). All these examples align with the call to *be ready*. The door of mercy will not stand open forever; when Christ comes, the opportunity to prepare ends, just as the rain of the Flood or the fire on Sodom ended any last chances. Thus, **living ready is imperative**. Jesus wants us to be like the wise virgins â€“ keeping our lamps of faith burning and full of oil â€“ so that whenever the cry rings out, <span style="color:red">Behold, the Bridegroom comes,</span> we can enter into the joy of His kingdom without delay.

## Do Not Be Weighed Down by Worldliness (Luke 21:34-36)

**Context:**  
- This warning appears toward the end of Lukeâ€™s account of the Olivet Discourse. After describing signs of His return, Jesus gave specific admonitions to His disciples about their personal conduct.  
- In Luke 21:34, He shifted focus from external signs to the **internal state of the believerâ€™s heart** when He comes. He listed things that can weigh down the heart: dissipation (overindulgence), drunkenness, and the cares of life.  
- Jesus wanted His followers not only to watch the signs but also to **watch themselves**. He concluded by urging them to **watch and pray always**, to have strength to escape the coming judgments and to stand before the Son of Man (Luke 21:36).

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life**, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. **Watch ye therefore, and pray always**, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these thingsâ€¦and to stand before the Son of man.</span> (Luke 21:34-36, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus cautions believers against **spiritual lethargy caused by worldly living**. <span style="color:red">Take heed to yourselves</span> means <span style="color:red">be careful about your own life.</span> The warning identifies three things that dull our spiritual senses: (1) **<span style="color:red">surfeiting</span>** â€“ this means carousing or overindulgence in food and entertainment (the nausea of excess); (2) **<span style="color:red">drunkenness</span>** â€“ intoxication, escaping into substance abuse; and (3) **<span style="color:red">cares of this life</span>** â€“ the worries and busyness of everyday life (jobs, finances, pleasures, etc.). Any of these can **weigh down the heart** (<span style="color:red">overcharged</span> meaning burdened or made heavy) and cause us to lose focus on Christâ€™s return. If we are consumed with partying, addictions, or even just the daily grind, <span style="color:red">that Day</span> (Christâ€™s return/judgment) can spring on us **like a trap** (<span style="color:red">as a snare</span>). The imagery suggests sudden capture because of inattention. Jesus warns that **most of the world will be caught unprepared**, like an animal caught in a snare. But it must not be so with His followers. Instead, we are to **stay alert (<span style="color:red">watch</span>) and prayerful** continually, so that we have the spiritual strength and readiness to escape the coming judgments and to stand confidently before Christ at His coming. To <span style="color:red">stand before the Son of Man</span> implies being able to endure His holy presence with joy rather than shrink back in shame or fear. In essence, Jesus is saying: *Donâ€™t let worldly pleasures or worries numb you.* Keep your eyes open and **maintain a prayerful communion with God**, so that when Christ returns, youâ€™re living in a way that He approves â€“ not in a stupor of worldly distraction. This warning complements <span style="color:red">Watch, for you know not the hour</span> by specifying internal conditions (gluttony, drunkenness, anxiety) that can make a person spiritually sleepy. Jesus urges a lifestyle of **sobriety, self-control, and focused devotion**, free from the overcharged heart that forgets eternity.

**Example in Scripture:** The story of **Belshazzar, king of Babylon** in Daniel 5 is a classic case of sudden judgment falling on someone **lost in worldly indulgence**. Belshazzar threw a lavish drunken feast for a thousand nobles, blasphemously using the sacred gold and silver vessels from Jerusalemâ€™s Temple to drink wine and praise idols (Daniel 5:1-4). In the midst of this revelry, **a mysterious hand appeared and wrote on the wall** â€“ a message of doom: *<span style="color:red">MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</span>* Daniel interpreted it: God had numbered Belshazzarâ€™s days, weighed him and found him wanting, and divided his kingdom (Daniel 5:24-28). That very night, as Belshazzar was caught off-guard in drunken stupor, **the city was taken by the Persians**. *<span style="color:red">In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans **slain***.</span> (Daniel 5:30, KJV) ([Daniel 5:30 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Daniel-5-30/#:~:text=In%20that%20night%20was%20Belshazzar,threescore%20and%20two%20years%20old)). The king was feasting and **not expecting his kingdom to fall**, but it did â€“ spectacularly and swiftly. Jesusâ€™s phrase <span style="color:red">as a snare it shall come</span> fits this â€“ the enemy armies entered Babylon like a trap while the Babylonians felt secure. Belshazzar was literally **<span style="color:red">overcharged</span> with surfeiting and drunkenness**, and the <span style="color:red">care</span> he failed to take was his spiritual state. His story foreshadows end-times conditions: many will be eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building (Luke 17:28) â€“ *totally absorbed in earthly life* â€“ until sudden destruction comes. Another biblical example is **Lotâ€™s sons-in-law** in Sodom. When Lot warned them that Godâ€™s judgment (fire and brimstone) was imminent, *<span style="color:red">he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law</span>* (Genesis 19:14). They thought it was a joke and continued business as usual. Consequently, they perished in Sodomâ€™s destruction because they did not take heed. In contrast, those who <span style="color:red">take heed</span> and remain separate from worldliness can escape. **Noah** took heed and built the ark, so he escaped the Flood. **Lot** took the angelsâ€™ warning seriously and fled Sodom (though his wifeâ€™s lingering attachment cost her life â€“ more on that next). Believers are called to live like **pilgrims**, not getting weighed down by this world (Hebrews 11:13). The early church, for example, lived in a state of expectancy and sobriety, often fasting and praying, detached from worldly excess. Jesusâ€™s warning in Luke 21 is essentially: *Donâ€™t be like Belshazzar or Lotâ€™s society.* Be like the faithful servant who stays awake. **Guard your heart** from the numbing influence of excess and anxiety, so that day will not catch you by surprise. If we obey, we will, like the wise virgins, be welcomed rather than shut out. If we ignore it, we risk the terrifying surprise that befell Belshazzar and the people of Sodom â€“ sudden irreversible judgment.

## Remember Lotâ€™s Wife (Luke 17:32)

**Context:**  
- Jesus, speaking about the coming of the Kingdom and the revealing of the Son of Man, used examples from history to illustrate how sudden that Day will be. He mentioned the days of Noah and the days of Lot â€“ people were carrying on with normal life until disaster struck (Luke 17:26-30).  
- Specifically regarding Lotâ€™s time, Jesus said that on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from heaven and destroyed everyone. Then He gave practical instructions: *<span style="color:red">In that day, let him who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away; and likewise let him that is in the field not turn back.</span>* (Luke 17:31).  
- Immediately following that, Jesus delivered one of the shortest yet most potent warnings in Scripture, encapsulated in three words: <span style="color:red">Remember Lotâ€™s wife.</span>

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Remember Lotâ€™s wife**.</span> (Luke 17:32, KJV)

**Meaning:** This terse warning calls to mind the well-known story of **Lotâ€™s wife**, who **looked back** at the burning city of Sodom despite the angelâ€™s explicit command not to (Genesis 19:17, 26). She was turned into a pillar of salt â€“ a tragic monument to disobedience and divided loyalty. When Jesus says <span style="color:red">remember Lotâ€™s wife,</span> He is warning us **not to cling to the world when God calls us to escape**. Lotâ€™s wife embodies a heart that, even in the moment of deliverance, **longs for the sinful life left behind**. In the context of Christâ€™s return, the warning is: when the time comes to follow Christ (whether at His return or in the moment of decision), **donâ€™t look back wistfully at your old life** or the material possessions and pleasures youâ€™re leaving. It is also a broader warning against **worldliness and half-hearted obedience**. Lotâ€™s wife was almost saved â€“ she physically left the city â€“ but **her heart remained in Sodom**, and it cost her life. Jesus implies that in the end times, some may outwardly associate with believers (like she associated with Lot) but **their attachment to worldly things will betray them**. <span style="color:red">Remember Lotâ€™s wife</span> is a sobering reminder that **starting out on the journey of salvation is not enough if our heart turns back**. We must endure, with our eyes forward on Christ, valuing Him above all. The next verse, Luke 17:33, reinforces the point: *<span style="color:red">Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.</span>* Lotâ€™s wife sought to <span style="color:red">save</span> or hang onto her old life in Sodom (thus losing her life), whereas those who willingly <span style="color:red">lose</span> that life â€“ leave it behind â€“ will find true life. In essence, the warning is **donâ€™t be a half-hearted disciple**. Donâ€™t be in love with the world so much that you disobey Godâ€™s command to separate from it. Because when judgment falls or when Christ appears, **a divided heart can be fatal**.

**Example in Scripture:** The obvious example is **Lotâ€™s wife herself**. In Genesis 19, angels literally dragged Lot, his wife, and daughters out of Sodom, instructing them, *<span style="color:red">Escape for thy life; **look not behind thee**â€¦ escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</span>* (Genesis 19:17). As they fled, *<span style="color:red">his wife **looked back** from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</span>* (Genesis 19:26, KJV) ([Genesis 19:26 KJV - King James Version - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019%3A26&version=KJV#:~:text=Gateway%20www,19%3A26%20in%20all%20English%20translations)). She presumably *lingered* or gazed back longingly at her home being destroyed, indicating regret or reluctance to leave it. The result was instant judgment â€“ she was frozen as a salt pillar, a poignant symbol of wasted opportunity and disobedience. Jesus specifically tells us to remember her, so that we do not repeat her error. Another biblical figure who had a similar misplaced longing is the Israelites in the wilderness: **many kept yearning for Egypt** even after God delivered them. They said, <span style="color:red">We remember the fishâ€¦ the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick</span> (Numbers 11:5). Their backward glance to Egypt (despite it being the place of their slavery) led them to complain and rebel against God and Moses. That generation died in the wilderness, never seeing the Promised Land, **because their hearts kept turning back to Egypt** instead of forward to Godâ€™s promise. Their fate parallels <span style="color:red">remember Lotâ€™s wife.</span> When one sets out to follow God, **looking back can lead to falling back** â€“ and losing the destiny God had planned. In the New Testament, we have warnings like Demas, **who forsook Paul <span style="color:red">having loved this present world</span>** (2 Timothy 4:10). Initially a fellow worker, Demas eventually looked back to the worldâ€™s comforts and abandoned the mission. Johnâ€™s Gospel also presents people like some Jewish rulers who believed in Jesus but wouldnâ€™t confess Him openly **because they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God** (John 12:42-43) â€“ in a sense, looking back to the approval of their peers, and thus endangering their souls. All these examples echo the same truth: **you cannot move forward in Godâ€™s salvation while constantly looking backward in love with the world**. Lotâ€™s wife physically escaped judgment for a short distance, but **her heartâ€™s backward glance brought judgment on her outside the city**. Jesus warns that at His coming, there will be no time for double-mindedness: *<span style="color:red">On that day, let the one on the housetop not come down to take his goods</span>* â€“ donâ€™t go back for your stuff. *<span style="color:red">Remember Lotâ€™s wife.</span>* Itâ€™s a call to hold everything â€“ even life itself â€“ loosely, and **cling to Christ wholeheartedly**. When He calls, obey without hesitation. Do not be like the rich young ruler who walked away sorrowful because he couldnâ€™t part with his wealth to follow Jesus (Mark 10:21-22). Rather, heed Christâ€™s warning: if He is leading you out of <span style="color:red">Sodom,</span> **donâ€™t look back**. Burn the bridges to sin and never long for what God calls you to leave. Only then can you go safely all the way to the refuge He provides.

## Sin No More, Lest a Worse Thing Come unto Thee (John 5:14)

**Context:**  
- In John 5, Jesus healed a man who had been an invalid for 38 years by the Pool of Bethesda. Jesus commanded him, <span style="color:red">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk,</span> and the man was instantly cured (John 5:8-9). This miracle took place on the Sabbath, which led to controversy with the Jewish authorities.  
- Later that day, Jesus **found the healed man in the Temple** (perhaps the man had gone there to offer thanks). Jesus then spoke a brief word of guidance and warning to him.  
- The text doesnâ€™t specify what the manâ€™s prior sins were, but Jesusâ€™s statement suggests that the manâ€™s original ailment may have been connected to sin (though not all sickness is due to personal sin â€“ see John 9:3). Regardless, now that he was healed, Jesus admonished him about his future conduct.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee**.</span> (John 5:14, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus essentially tells the man, <span style="color:red">You have been healed â€“ both physically and (implied) given an opportunity for spiritual restoration. **Do not return to a life of sin**, or something even worse may happen to you.</span> The warning indicates that continued or deliberate sin after receiving Godâ€™s grace can lead to **graver consequences**. For this man, <span style="color:red">a worse thing</span> could imply an even more debilitating illness or tragedy, or ultimately **the loss of his soul** (which is worse than any physical malady). Itâ€™s a personal warning that carries a general truth: **Godâ€™s mercy in delivering us should lead us to repentance and holiness, not back into sin**. Jesus expects that being <span style="color:red">made whole</span> (whether in body or in spirit) should produce a changed life. If one *spurns* that grace and goes back to sin, they may end up in a worse state than before. This concept is echoed in 2 Peter 2:20, which says if people escape the pollutions of the world through knowing Christ but then are entangled again, *<span style="color:red">the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</span>* It also resonates with Jesusâ€™s teaching about an evicted unclean spirit returning with seven worse spirits to an empty house â€“ *<span style="color:red">the last state of that man is worse than the first</span>* (Matthew 12:45 ([Matthew 12:45 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-12-45/#:~:text=Matthew%2012%3A45%20,Previous%20Verse%20%C2%B7%20Next))). Thus, the warning <span style="color:red">sin no more</span> is both an encouragement to live righteously and a caution that **abusing Godâ€™s grace leads to greater suffering**. Not every unfortunate event is due to sin (see Luke 13:1-5), but Jesus clearly links this manâ€™s potential future suffering (<span style="color:red">worse thing</span>) with the choice to sin. Spiritually, the <span style="color:red">worse thing</span> could ultimately be **eternal separation from God** if repentance is never embraced. So Jesusâ€™s words carry the weight of: *Youâ€™ve been given a new start; donâ€™t go back to your old ways, or you risk something far worse than 38 years of infirmity.* Itâ€™s a loving warning to utilize Godâ€™s gift (healing) towards a life of obedience.

**Example in Scripture:** A powerful example of someone who initially escaped consequences but later faced worse for returning to sin is **King Saul**. God gave Saul many chances. After Saul disobeyed Godâ€™s command in the Amalekite war, Samuel warned him that God rejected him as king (1 Samuel 15). Instead of truly repenting, Saul continued down a path of jealousy (especially against David), violence, and even occult practices. Saul had moments of remorse (e.g., 1 Samuel 24:16-17 when he momentarily acknowledged his wrong toward David), but he didnâ€™t <span style="color:red">sin no more</span> â€“ he kept pursuing David to kill him. In the end, Saulâ€™s life ended in disaster: defeated by the Philistines, **wounded and then falling on his own sword** (1 Samuel 31:4). Not only he, but his sons died in the battle, and Israel was routed â€“ a <span style="color:red">worse</span> fate than the loss of kingship that was initially pronounced. Jesusâ€™s warning <span style="color:red">lest a worse thing come</span> is encapsulated by Saulâ€™s trajectory: he could have humbled himself and sought God (like David did after sinning), but persisting in sin led to a worse end. Another biblical illustration is found in Jesusâ€™s own teaching. In **John 8:11**, Jesus tells the woman caught in adultery, *<span style="color:red">Neither do I condemn thee: **go, and sin no more**.</span>* This is essentially the same warning minus the stated consequence. Jesus extended mercy (no immediate condemnation) but expected a change â€“ no more adultery â€“ thereby saving her from the worse fate of spiritual death from continued sin. The early church also saw cases like **Ananias and Sapphira** (Acts 5 again): they were part of the church (thus <span style="color:red">made whole</span> in one sense, having the opportunity of salvation), but they sinned by lying to God. The <span style="color:red">worse thing</span> â€“ sudden death â€“ came swiftly upon them as a stark warning to the church about sin. Another more metaphorical example is found in **2 Peter 2:21-22**, which compares those who return to sin to a dog going back to its vomit or a sow to wallowing in the mire. They had escaped the worldâ€™s corruption for a time but then returned to filth, ending up worse off. This imagery strongly parallels Jesusâ€™s words in John 5: it is revolting and dangerous to revert to sin after receiving Godâ€™s grace. The **demon parable** Jesus gave (Matthew 12:43-45) is practically a commentary on <span style="color:red">lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span> In that parable, a man is freed from an unclean spirit (symbolizing deliverance), but the manâ€™s <span style="color:red">house</span> remains empty â€“ he doesnâ€™t fill his life with God. The freed man does not change his ways or invite righteousness to dwell. The expelled demon later finds the house empty, brings seven more demons, *<span style="color:red">and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</span>* ([Matthew 12:45 - King James Bible](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-12-45/#:~:text=Matthew%2012%3A45%20,Previous%20Verse%20%C2%B7%20Next)). Why? Because deliverance wasnâ€™t followed by repentance and filling with Godâ€™s Spirit. Jesus warns the healed man at Bethesda to avoid this tragic outcome: **embrace your healing fully by walking in obedience**. For us, the lesson is clear: when God forgives or delivers us, we must not take it lightly. We are called to **repent and live differently**, lest something worse â€“ be it earthly chastisement or eternal loss â€“ come upon us. Godâ€™s grace is not a license to sin; itâ€™s an opportunity to start fresh. *<span style="color:red">Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid!</span>* (Romans 6:1-2). Jesusâ€™s gentle yet firm warning to <span style="color:red">sin no more</span> is an expression of His desire that the man (and we) live in the wholeness that Godâ€™s mercy provides, and avoid the painful consequences of returning to sinâ€™s bondage.

## If Ye Believe Not, Ye Shall Die in Your Sins (John 8:24)

**Context:**  
- In John 8, Jesus was speaking in the Temple treasury to a group that included Pharisees and other Jews. He made bold claims about His identity (such as <span style="color:red">I am the light of the world</span> in John 8:12) and about His relationship with the Father. The Jewish leaders were skeptical and hostile, asking, <span style="color:red">Who art thou?</span> (John 8:25).  
- Jesus told them they were from beneath (earthly) and He is from above (heavenly), and that unless they believed in Him, they would die in their sins (John 8:23-24). This statement is a direct warning of the spiritual consequence of **refusing to believe** that Jesus is who He claims to be (<span style="color:red">that I am he</span>).  
- The phrase <span style="color:red">die in your sins</span> is the opposite of being saved from sins; it implies dying **still guilty**, without forgiveness â€“ a dire outcome.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins**.</span> (John 8:24, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus places **faith in Himself** as the dividing line between forgiveness and unforgiveness. <span style="color:red">I am he</span> in the context likely means <span style="color:red">I am who I claim to be</span> â€“ the Messiah, the Son of God, the Light of the world, one with the Father. Some see an echo of the divine name <span style="color:red">I AM</span> here as well. Essentially, Jesus warns that **unbelief has fatal consequences**: to reject Jesus (or to persist in willful unbelief) is to remain in oneâ€™s sins, and therefore to **die guilty before God**. To <span style="color:red">die in your sins</span> means to die separated from God by the guilt of sin, thus facing judgment rather than life. The sobering implication is that **faith in Jesus is the only way out of sin**. If one does not believe in Him, all their sins remain charged against them, for only through Jesus can sins be forgiven (Acts 10:43). This warning was directed at religious people who did not accept Christ â€“ showing that **heritage or religiosity cannot save**; only belief in Jesus can. Jesus follows this in John 8 by saying, <span style="color:red">If you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins,</span> and later, <span style="color:red">If the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed</span> (John 8:36). The contrast is clear: **belief leads to freedom from sin, unbelief leads to dying in bondage to sin**. This is essentially the Gospel in negative form â€“ John 3:18 states the same truth positively and negatively: *<span style="color:red">He that believeth on Him is not condemned: but **he that believeth not is condemned already**, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span>* Jesusâ€™s warning in John 8:24 is a straightforward declaration of what is at stake in responding to Him. It applies universally: **everyone must deal with Jesus** â€“ to ignore or reject Him is to remain in oneâ€™s sins and thus under condemnation.

**Example in Scripture:** Tragically, many of the very people Jesus spoke to **refused to believe** and thus later <span style="color:red">died in their sins</span> when judgment came. A specific example might be the **religious leaders** who orchestrated Jesusâ€™s crucifixion. Jesus on the cross prayed, <span style="color:red">Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do</span> (Luke 23:34). Yet forgiveness is not automatic; those leaders would need to repent and believe to be saved. Some priests did later believe (Acts 6:7), but many did not. Within 40 years, Jerusalem faced catastrophic judgment in A.D. 70. Jesus had prophesied that tragedy as well, linking it to their unbelief (Luke 19:41-44). The **Jewish generation of Jesusâ€™s day**, by and large, refused their Messiah. Jesus warned in John 8 that unless they believe, theyâ€™d die in their sins; historically, a vast number of them perished when Rome destroyed the city, and, worse, according to the New Testament, those who persisted in rejecting Christ will face **eternal judgment** (Romans 2:5). For a more individual example: **Judas Iscariot** â€“ he lived and worked with Jesus but ultimately **did not truly believe in who Jesus was** (at least, not in a saving way; he valued 30 pieces of silver over Christ). Judas died by suicide, tragically <span style="color:red">in his sins</span> â€“ Jesus called him <span style="color:red">the son of perdition</span> (John 17:12). In contrast to Peter (who believed in Jesus and repented after denying Him), Judas did not turn back to Christ. He died bearing the guilt of betrayal, illustrating Jesusâ€™s warning on a personal level. Another biblical example: **the Israelites who fell in the wilderness** â€“ Hebrews 3:19 says, *<span style="color:red">they could not enter in [to the Promised Land] because of unbelief.</span>* That entire generation died in their sins (except Joshua and Caleb), never seeing the promise, because they did not trust Godâ€™s word. While thatâ€™s Old Covenant, the New Testament uses it as a cautionary parallel: *<span style="color:red">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God</span>* (Hebrews 3:12). Unbelief kept the Israelites out of the earthly rest, and unbelief will keep anyone out of Godâ€™s eternal rest (Hebrews 4:1-3). **Belief in Jesus** is the only remedy. We also see in Acts 13:46 Paul telling the Jews in Pisidian Antioch, *<span style="color:red">Seeing ye put [the Word of God] from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</span>* Those who thrust aside the gospel in unbelief essentially <span style="color:red">judge themselves unworthy</span> â€“ that is, **they refuse the salvation offered and thus remain in condemnation**. Jesusâ€™s words <span style="color:red">you will die in your sins</span> put the responsibility on the listener: *if* you do not believe, *then* you will die guilty. Conversely, *if* you believe in Him, *then* your sins will be washed away and you will die in Godâ€™s grace, not in sin. One more positive-negative pair: In John 8:24, Jesus warns the unbelieving that they will die in their sins. In John 8:51, a few verses later, He gives the flip side: *<span style="color:red">Verily, verily, I say unto you, **If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death**.</span>* To <span style="color:red">keep Jesusâ€™s saying</span> implies believing and obeying Him. Such a person will not experience the <span style="color:red">second death</span> of condemnation (Revelation 20:14). In summary, the **unbeliever dies in sin; the believer dies in the Lord** (cf. Revelation 14:13, <span style="color:red">Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord</span>). Jesusâ€™s warning is as stark as it is loving: He plainly tells us the outcome of rejecting Him so that we might choose life by believing. As John 3:36 sums up, *<span style="color:red">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and **he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him**.</span>* Those are effectively two sides of the same coin â€“ the promise and the warning â€“ urging all to **believe in the Son** so as not to remain under wrath.

## If Anyone Does Not Abide in Me (John 15:6)

**Context:**  
- On the night before His crucifixion, after the Last Supper, Jesus gave an extended private teaching to His disciples (John 13â€“16). In John 15, He used the analogy of the **vine and branches** to describe their relationship with Him. Jesus said, <span style="color:red">I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresserâ€¦ you are the branches</span> (John 15:1,5).  
- He emphasized the need for the disciples to <span style="color:red">abide</span> (remain) in Him, and for His words to abide in them, in order to bear fruit. Abiding implies **continuous, living connection** â€“ essentially, true faith and fellowship.  
- As part of this analogy, Jesus included a sober warning about the fate of any branch that does not remain in Him.

**Jesusâ€™s Warning:** <span style="color:red">**If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned**.</span> (John 15:6, KJV)

**Meaning:** Jesus warns that **separation from Him leads to destruction**. Just as a branch severed from the vine inevitably withers and is only good for firewood, so a person who does not remain connected to Jesus will lose spiritual life and face judgment (<span style="color:red">fire</span>). In the immediate context, this could allude to someone like Judas (who had just left the group in John 13 and did not <span style="color:red">abide</span> in Christ, and whose end was disastrous). More generally, it speaks of the **necessity of persevering faith**. <span style="color:red">Abide in me</span> means to continue trusting, obeying, and communing with Christ. If someone only **appears** to be a disciple for a time but does not truly remain (like an apostate or false convert), they show that they have no life in them â€“ they <span style="color:red">wither</span> spiritually. Such branches ultimately are gathered and thrown into the fire â€“ a clear image of **judgment (hell)**. This warning underscores that it is not enough to have a one-time association with Jesus; what matters is **enduring union**. Itâ€™s similar to how John the Baptist warned the Jews: *<span style="color:red">Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire</span>* (Matthew 3:10). Here the focus is on maintaining the vital connection to Christ which alone can produce fruit. Some theological debates surround this verse (can a true believer fall away, etc.), but regardless of oneâ€™s stance, the practical thrust is: **remaining in Christ is absolutely essential**. If someone does <span style="color:red">fall away</span> or never truly remains, their fate is like a dead branch burned up. The <span style="color:red">fire</span> in biblical language consistently points to divine judgment (Matthew 25:41, Revelation 20:15). Jesus, in love, is warning His disciples of the high stakes of **not staying faithful**. It calls each professing believer to examine: am I truly abiding in Christ? The comfort, conversely, is in the prior verse: *<span style="color:red">He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit</span>* (John 15:5). Abiding leads to fruitfulness and life; not abiding leads to fire. Itâ€™s a vivid picture encouraging us to **cling to Jesus daily**.

**Example in Scripture:** **Judas Iscariot** again is a prime example of a branch that did not abide. He was one of the twelve branches ostensibly connected to the Vine (Christ) during Jesusâ€™s ministry. But Judasâ€™s heart drifted; he entertained theft and betrayal. Ultimately, he disconnected from Jesus entirely by betraying Him. Judas then withered in despair and ended up destroying himself. His story tragically illustrates a branch cast off and burned. On the other hand, the eleven remaining disciples (minus Judas) all **stumbled** to some degree (they fled at Jesusâ€™s arrest, Peter denied Jesus), but they **returned and remained** in Christâ€™s love, and thus were not cast off. They bore fruit (as seen in Acts and their subsequent ministries) and their connection to Christ only deepened after the resurrection. Another biblical example: in 1 John 2:19, John speaks of certain people who *<span style="color:red">went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued (remained) with us.</span>* This describes individuals in the early church who **did not abide** â€“ they departed from the fellowship and the doctrine of Christ, showing they were never truly <span style="color:red">of us</span> (truly saved) to begin with. Their departure manifested their lack of genuine connection to Christ. Such individuals, if they persist in departure, face the fearful prospect of judgment. The author of Hebrews gives a similar warning: *<span style="color:red">If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire</span>* (Hebrews 10:26-27). While addressed to a community, it warns those who would turn away from Christ (after knowing of Him) that the result is fiery judgment â€“ very much echoing <span style="color:red">cast into the fire and burned.</span> We also have Jesusâ€™s Parable of the **Sower** (Luke 8:5-15). Two of the four soils represent people who believed for a while (the rocky soil <span style="color:red">received the word with joy</span> but had no root and fell away in time of testing; the thorny soil allowed the word to be choked by cares and pleasures of life). These didnâ€™t abide â€“ they **did not persevere to fruit-bearing**. Only the good soil held fast and produced fruit. The fate of the barren ones is not explicitly stated in that parable, but by analogy with John 15, fruitless, withered plants are ultimately discarded. Therefore, Jesusâ€™s warning in John 15:6 aligns with numerous New Testament passages urging **continuance in Christ**. Paul, for instance, warns Gentile believers in Romans 11:20-22 not to be proud but to continue in Godâ€™s kindness, *<span style="color:red">otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</span>* Thatâ€™s using the metaphor of Israel as branches cut off and Gentiles grafted in â€“ but the principle is the same: **faith must continue; otherwise, like unbelieving Israel, one can be <span style="color:red">cut off.</span>** In sum, any branch (person) that **detaches from Christ â€“ the only source of spiritual life â€“ has no other destiny but to dry up and face the fire.** It is a dire warning against apostasy and a call to endurance. But itâ€™s also inherently an invitation: *<span style="color:red">Abide in Me, and I in you</span>* (John 15:4). Those who abide have nothing to fear from this warning; it serves to spur them to remain steadfast. Those who are toying with leaving Christâ€™s fellowship or forsaking His teachings should hear it as a loving alarm bell: **apart from Jesus, there is no life â€“ only judgment**. Stay connected to the Vine, and you will live and bear fruit; cut yourself off, and you sign your own death warrant. Jesus desires not to cast off any branch â€“ earlier He said, *<span style="color:red">Anyone who comes to Me I will in no wise cast out</span>* (John 6:37). But if a branch will not <span style="color:red">come</span> or <span style="color:red">remain,</span> then casting out and burning is all thatâ€™s left. Thus, John 15:6 stands as a solemn reminder to **continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel** (Colossians 1:23), for **outside of Christ there is no salvation**.

## Final Exhortation: Heed Jesusâ€™s Warnings

Jesus Christâ€™s warnings across the four Gospels cover a wide range of spiritual dangers â€“ from hypocrisy and pride, to unbelief, greed, lack of readiness, and more. Each warning comes with both an **immediate context** and an enduring lesson for us today. Taken together, they call us to:

- **Walk in genuine faith and humility** (avoiding hypocrisy like the Pharisees, and instead being <span style="color:red">real</span> with God and others).  
- **Value Christ above all** (beware of covetousness, donâ€™t love the world or fear man more than God).  
- **Be vigilant and steadfast** (stay spiritually awake, prepared for His return and faithful in obedience, forgiving others, and abiding in Him to the end).  
- **Repent and turn from sin** (knowing that ongoing rebellion or refusal to believe in Jesus leads to judgment, whereas His grace leads to life when received rightly).

Each warning Jesus gave is ultimately rooted in His love and desire that we **not perish but have everlasting life** (John 3:16-17). They are like signposts on the road of life, marked with flashing lights and bold letters to save us from disaster. It is up to us to <span style="color:red">take heed.</span> As the author of Hebrews says, *<span style="color:red">See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh</span>* (Hebrews 12:25). May we **remember these warnings**, internalize their lessons, and so live in the light of Christ â€“ in reverence, in sincerity, and in full devotion â€“ bearing fruit to Godâ€™s glory and awaiting our Lordâ€™s return with joy rather than fear. Jesus has shown us the way of life; **let us heed His warnings and follow Him**, for in Him is found safety, forgiveness, and eternal life. 

**<span style="color:red">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear</span>** (Matthew 11:15). Amen.
