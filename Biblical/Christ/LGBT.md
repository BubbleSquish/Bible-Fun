## Thesis

Traditional Christianity holds that **God created humanity male and female** and ordered sexual relations within **one-flesh marriage** between a man and a woman. Both **transgender self-identification** and **homosexual behavior** contradict this creation order. They are not parallel "identities" but **forms of rebellion against the givenness of the body**. Scripture consistently condemns such practices while affirming that all people are redeemable through Christ.

## 1) Creation and Marriage as the Ground

- **Genesis 1:27**: Sexual difference is built into humanity's image-bearing role.  
- **Genesis 2:24**: Marriage is defined as male-female union. Other unions are excluded by design.  
- Jesus upholds this order: **Matthew 19:4-6**. "What God has joined, let not man separate."

---

## 2) Homosexual Practice in Scripture

- **Leviticus 18:22; 20:13**: Homosexual acts are called an "abomination" and judged under Mosaic law.  
- **Romans 1:26-27**: Paul identifies same-sex desire and acts as "contrary to nature," a result of idolatry and rejection of the Creator.  
- **1 Corinthians 6:9-11**: Lists "men who practice homosexuality" among sins barring entry to the kingdomâ€”but then declares, "such were some of you." Redemption is possible.  
- **1 Timothy 1:9-10**: Places homosexual practice among acts contrary to sound doctrine.  
- **Hebrews 13:4**: Sexual morality is bounded by marriage. Any sexual relationship outside male-female marriage is condemned.

## 3) Transgenderism in Scripture

While the modern concept of transgenderism is not explicitly named in Scripture, the principles that inform the Christian view are deeply rooted in the biblical text.

- **Deuteronomy 22:5**: The prohibition against cross-dressing is not merely about clothing but about rejecting one's God-given sexual identity and the fundamental distinction between male and female.
- **1 Corinthians 11:14-15**: Appeals to "nature itself" to affirm that the physical distinctions between men and women are meaningful and should be honored.
- **Romans 1:24-27**: The exchange of "natural relations for those that are contrary to nature" encompasses not only homosexual acts but also the broader rejection of the natural, created order of the body.
- **1 Corinthians 6:19-20**: The body is not a self-owned project to be redesigned, but a temple of the Holy Spirit, belonging to God and to be glorified as He created it.

---

## 4) The Body as Moral Witness

Both transgenderism and homosexuality treat the body as **secondary to desire or self-perception**.

- **Psalm 139**: The body is God's intentional design, "knit together" by Him.
- **1 Corinthians 6:19-20**: Believers' bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, bought with a price; we are to glorify God *with* our bodies, not in spite of them.
- To deny the biological reality of one's sex (transgenderism) or to use the body for same-sex acts (homosexuality) is to fundamentally dishonor God's design and authority as Creator.

---

## 5) Jesus' Teaching and Implications

- **Matthew 19**: Jesus roots marriage in male-female creation.  
- **Luke 9:23**: Discipleship = self-denial, not indulging passions.  
- **Matthew 18:6**: Leading children into sin carries severe warning.  
- **John 8:32**: "The truth will set you free." Falsehood about sex or marriage cannot liberate.  

By implication:  
- Jesus' ethic leaves no space for legitimizing homosexual relationships.  
- His compassion never equaled approval of sin; He forgave but commanded repentance (**John 8:11**).  

---

## 6) Theological Synthesis

- **Homosexuality** denies the **complementarity of male and female** and the **telos of marriage**: procreation, unity, reflection of Christ and the Church.
- **Transgenderism** denies the **givenness of sexed embodiment** and asserts a subjective identity apart from God's objective design. It represents a form of Gnosticism that privileges the inner self over the physical creation God called "very good."
- Both distort God's image in humanity and mislead about Christ's relationship to His people (Ephesians 5:22-33).
- Both are ultimately rooted in the primal sin of rejecting God as Creator and seeking to define good and evil for oneself (Genesis 3:5).

## 7) Pastoral Approach

- **Clarity**: Call both sins what they are.  
- **Compassion**: Offer gospel hope, not affirmation of error.  
- **Community**: Provide support and accountability for believers seeking holiness.  
- **Warning**: Do not compromise truth for cultural acceptance; Scripture is consistent and unambiguous.  

---

## 8) The Hope of the Gospel

- **1 Corinthians 6:11**: "And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." This is the hope for all who struggle with same-sex attraction or gender confusion.
- The gospel offers **new identity in Christ**, which supersedes all other identities (2 Corinthians 5:17).
- It provides the **power of the Holy Spirit** for transformation and obedience, even in areas of deep personal struggle (Romans 8:13-14).
- It promises **grace for the journey**, not just a one-time forgiveness, enabling believers to walk in increasing holiness (Hebrews 4:16).

## 9) Conclusion

Both transgenderism and homosexuality stand in opposition to God's order established in **creation**, reaffirmed by **Jesus**, and consistently applied by the **apostles**. Christian faithfulness requires rejecting them as valid identities or practices, while extending the hope of the gospel and the call to repentance to all. The Church must uphold God's design with both conviction and compassion, speaking the truth in love, and pointing all people toward the redemption and restoration found only in Jesus Christ.
