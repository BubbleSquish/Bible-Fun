## Thesis

Traditional Christianity holds that **God created humanity male and female** and ordered sexual relations within **one-flesh marriage** between a man and a woman. Both **transgender self-identification** and **homosexual behavior** contradict this creation order. They are not parallel “identities” but **forms of rebellion against the givenness of the body**. Scripture consistently condemns such practices while affirming that all people are redeemable through Christ.

## 1) Creation and Marriage as the Ground

- **Genesis 1:27**: Sexual difference is built into humanity’s image-bearing role.  
- **Genesis 2:24**: Marriage is defined as male–female union. Other unions are excluded by design.  
- Jesus upholds this order: **Matthew 19:4–6**. “What God has joined, let not man separate.”

## 2) Homosexual Practice in Scripture

- **Leviticus 18:22; 20:13**: Homosexual acts are called an “abomination” and judged under Mosaic law.  
- **Romans 1:26–27**: Paul identifies same-sex desire and acts as “contrary to nature,” a result of idolatry and rejection of the Creator.  
- **1 Corinthians 6:9–11**: Lists “men who practice homosexuality” among sins barring entry to the kingdom—but then declares, “such were some of you.” Redemption is possible.  
- **1 Timothy 1:9–10**: Places homosexual practice among acts contrary to sound doctrine.  
- **Hebrews 13:4**: Sexual morality is bounded by marriage. Any sexual relationship outside male–female marriage is condemned.

## 3) The Body as Moral Witness

Both transgenderism and homosexuality treat the body as **secondary to desire**.  
- **Psalm 139**: The body is God’s design.  
- **1 Corinthians 6:19–20**: Believers’ bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit.  
- To deny or misuse the body is to dishonor God.

## 4) Jesus’ Teaching and Implications

- **Matthew 19**: Jesus roots marriage in male–female creation.  
- **Luke 9:23**: Discipleship = self-denial, not indulging passions.  
- **Matthew 18:6**: Leading children into sin carries severe warning.  
- **John 8:32**: “The truth will set you free.” Falsehood about sex or marriage cannot liberate.  

By implication:  
- Jesus’ ethic leaves no space for legitimizing homosexual relationships.  
- His compassion never equaled approval of sin; He forgave but commanded repentance (**John 8:11**).

## 5) Theological Synthesis

- **Homosexuality** denies the **complementarity of male and female** and the **telos of marriage**: procreation, unity, reflection of Christ and the Church.  
- **Transgenderism** denies the **givenness of sexed embodiment** and asserts identity apart from God’s design.  
- Both distort God’s image in humanity and mislead about Christ’s relationship to His people.

## 6) Pastoral Approach

- **Clarity**: Call both sins what they are.  
- **Compassion**: Offer gospel hope, not affirmation of error.  
- **Community**: Provide support and accountability for believers seeking holiness.  
- **Warning**: Do not compromise truth for cultural acceptance; Scripture is consistent and unambiguous.

## 7) Conclusion

Both transgenderism and homosexuality stand in opposition to God’s order established in **creation**, reaffirmed by **Jesus**, and consistently applied by the **apostles**. Christian faithfulness requires rejecting them as valid identities or practices, while extending the
