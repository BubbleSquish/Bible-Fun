## 1) The Enemy Exposed

Jesus identifies the enemy as a liar from the start and the father of lies, a murderer who hates the light (John 8:44; John 3:19–20). Scripture names him the deceiver and accuser (Revelation 12:9–10). When truth shows up, his works get exposed, so he counters with counterfeit power, signs, and **lying wonders** aimed at those who refuse the love of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:9–10).

## 1a) [**Satan.md — The Adversary**](https://github.com/BubbleSquish/Bible-Fun/blob/main/Biblical/Christ/Satan.md)

> *“The adversary hates the holy.”*

This section expands on the biblical picture of Satan:  
- **The liar and father of lies** (John 8:44).  
- **The accuser of the brethren** (Revelation 12:10).  
- **The deceiver of the whole world** (Revelation 12:9).  

It ties directly into the theme of purity: *the devil hates signs of purity*. His schemes are exposed whenever holiness shines, and his fury grows because Christ — the spotless Lamb — has already won the victory. Believers are reminded that though he prowls, he is a defeated foe, overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of testimony (Revelation 12:11).

## 2) Why Purity Is Attacked

Purity undermines his grip because it originates in God: “the wisdom from above is first **pure**” (James 3:17), and the pure in heart **see God** (Matthew 5:8). He therefore moves with subtlety—corrupting minds from the **simplicity** in Christ (2 Corinthians 11:3) and disguising himself **as an angel of light** (2 Corinthians 11:14). He targets pure worship (John 4:24), holy living (1 Thessalonians 4:3–7), and single-hearted devotion, baiting with the **lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the pride of life** (1 John 2:16).

## 3) Stand Your Ground

Orders of the day: **be sober, be vigilant** (1 Peter 5:8). **Submit to God; resist the devil** and he will **flee** (James 4:7). **Armor up** to stand against the schemes of the devil (Ephesians 6:11–13). Guard your heart (Proverbs 4:23), set your mind on what is **pure** (Philippians 4:8), and keep yourself in hope and holiness (1 John 3:3). The Son of God appeared to **destroy the works of the devil** (1 John 3:8); you overcome **by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony** (Revelation 12:11).
