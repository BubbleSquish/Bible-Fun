# Divine Warnings in the Book of Revelation (KJV)

> **Table of Warnings:**  
> For a quick reference, see the [Summary Table of Warnings in Revelation](#summary-table-of-warnings-in-revelation) at the end of this document. Each warning below is marked with a table reference (e.g., [Table: Ephesus], [Table: First Seal], etc.) for cross-checking.

## Warnings in Jesus’ Messages to the Seven Churches (Revelation 1–3)

* **Ephesus (Rev 2:5)** [Table: Ephesus] – *“Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; **or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent**.”* **Meaning:** Christ warns the Ephesian church that if they do not rekindle the love and devotion they once had, He will **remove their “candlestick” (lampstand)** – symbolically snuffing out their light and witness as a church. **Context:** Addressed to a doctrinally sound church that had left its “first love” (2:4). Jesus urges them to remember their former zeal and repent, or face swift judgment by His coming. The removal of the lampstand signifies the church would **cease to exist as a shining congregation** if they failed to repent. **Cross-Reference:** The call to “remember… and repent” echoes God’s plea to backslidden Israel to remember her early devotion (Jeremiah 2:2-3). Losing one’s lampstand parallels Jesus’ warning that salt which loses its savor is “good for nothing” (Matthew 5:13) – without love, even orthodox works are dead.

* **Smyrna (Rev 2:10)** [Table: Smyrna] – *“Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and **ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life**.”* **Meaning:** Jesus alerts Smyrna of coming persecution – a period of intense suffering (“ten days”). They are encouraged **not to fear but to remain faithful even to the point of death**, with the promise of the *crown of life* as a reward for their martyrdom. **Context:** The church in Smyrna was spiritually rich but about to face imprisonment and trials for Christ. Unlike other churches, Smyrna receives no rebuke – only a warning of impending trials and an exhortation to endure. This is a **comforting warning**: though they may die, they will conquer through steadfast faith and receive eternal life. **Cross-Reference:** The “crown of life” for those who persevere in trials is also mentioned in James 1:12. Jesus’ call to be “faithful unto death” reflects His own teaching: *“Be thou faithful unto death”* – essentially, *“be faithful even to death and I will give you life”* (cf. Matthew 10:28, 32).

* **Pergamum (Pergamos) (Rev 2:16)** [Table: Pergamum] – *“Repent; **or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth**.”* **Meaning:** Christ commands the church at Pergamum to repent of tolerating false teachings (the doctrines of *Balaam* and *the Nicolaitans*). If they do not purge this compromise, Jesus warns He will come in judgment “quickly,” waging war against those persisting in error **with the sword of His mouth** (symbolic of the Word of God’s sharp judgment). **Context:** Pergamum was a church holding fast to Jesus’ name yet compromising with idolatry and immorality taught by some in their midst (2:14–15). The warning is directed to the whole church, but especially “them” – the false teachers or those following them. Christ’s **swift intervention** with the sword of His mouth implies He Himself will purge the church of evil if they do not act. **Cross-Reference:** *“Judgment must begin at the house of God”* (1 Peter 4:17), a truth reflected in Jesus’ threat to fight the church’s corrupters. The “sword” from Jesus’ mouth is also seen in Revelation 19:15, 21 when He strikes down the wicked – it represents His authoritative, piercing Word (cf. Hebrews 4:12).

* **Thyatira (Rev 2:22–23)** [Table: Thyatira] – *“Behold, **I will cast her into a bed**, and them that commit adultery with her into **great tribulation**, except they repent of their deeds. **And I will kill her children with death;** and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and **I will give unto every one of you according to your works**.”* **Meaning:** Jesus warns that *“Jezebel”* – a false prophetess seducing the church into idolatry and sexual sin – will be cast onto a sickbed of suffering along with her followers, **unless they repent**. He even threatens to slay her “children” (devotees) as a shocking judgment. This severe discipline is meant as an example: *“all the churches shall know”* that Christ searches every heart and repays each according to their deeds. **Context:** The church in Thyatira was growing in love and service, but tolerating this woman symbolically called *Jezebel* who promoted blatant compromise (2:20-21). Jesus had given her time to repent, which she spurned (2:21), so now **illness, affliction, and death** would befall her and her partners in sin. This warning also serves the *faithful remnant* in Thyatira (2:24-25) – encouraging them that Christ’s holiness will not spare persistent sin in their midst. **Cross-Reference:** The language evokes Jezebel’s fate in the Old Testament – she was cast down and killed (2 Kings 9:32–37). It also parallels God’s use of sickness to chasten sinning believers (1 Corinthians 11:30). The principle that God “searches hearts and minds” and gives to each according to works is affirmed elsewhere (Jeremiah 17:10, Romans 2:6).

* **Sardis (Rev 3:3)** [Table: Sardis] – *“**Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard**, and hold fast, and **repent**. **If therefore thou shalt not watch**, **I will come on thee as a thief**, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.”* **Meaning:** Christ warns the church of Sardis – which had a reputation for life but was spiritually dead (3:1) – to **wake up and repent**. They must recall the truth they once embraced, obey it, and turn back to God. If they remain spiritually asleep, Jesus will come upon them **like a thief** at an unexpected hour, bringing judgment. **Context:** Sardis is charged with incomplete works and lethargy. A few in Sardis are still “worthy” (3:4), but the majority are in a complacent slumber. The warning of coming “as a thief” suggests sudden and unanticipated punishment – either temporal judgment or being unprepared at Christ’s return. It echoes Jesus’ own admonitions in the Gospels that His coming can catch the unwatchful by surprise. **Cross-Reference:** *“If you will not watch, I will come like a thief”* directly alludes to Jesus’ teaching (Matthew 24:42–43, Luke 12:39–40) and Paul’s reminder that the Day of the Lord comes “as a thief in the night” on the unsuspecting (1 Thessalonians 5:2–3). Believers are therefore called to be awake and alert (1 Thess. 5:6).

* **Philadelphia (Rev 3:11)** [Table: Philadelphia] – *“Behold, **I come quickly**: **hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown**.”* **Meaning:** Jesus assures Philadelphia of His imminent coming and urges them to **hold firmly to their faith and faithfulness** so that no one can seize their crown (their reward or honor). This is a warning not to let down their guard or abandon the truth, lest they forfeit what they have gained. **Context:** The Philadelphian church had kept Christ’s word and not denied His name (3:8). They have an open door of opportunity and a promise of preservation (3:10). The warning is therefore preventative – **don’t let anyone rob you of your victory crown by lapsing**. It implies that through compromise or neglect they could lose rewards (though not salvation). **Cross-Reference:** The imagery of an enduring “crown” goes along with running a race steadfastly. Paul wrote of running to win an incorruptible crown (1 Corinthians 9:24–25) and at life’s end declared he had kept the faith and a crown awaited him (2 Timothy 4:7–8). Jesus’ urgent “I come quickly” (meaning suddenly) emphasizes the need for constant readiness. Colossians 2:18 similarly warns not to let anyone defraud you of your reward.

* **Laodicea (Rev 3:16)** [Table: Laodicea] – *“So then because thou art **lukewarm**, and neither cold nor hot, **I will spue thee out of my mouth**.”* **Meaning:** Jesus rebukes the Laodicean church for its tepid, half-hearted faith. They are **“lukewarm”** – providing neither refreshment nor healing, just a distasteful tepidity. The warning is stark: if they continue in this nauseating spiritual state, Christ will “spit” or vomit them out – rejecting them from fellowship with Him. **Context:** Laodicea prided itself on wealth and self-sufficiency, yet spiritually they were **“wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked”** (3:17). Their compromise and complacency made Christ ill, figuratively speaking. He urges them to seek true riches and garments from Him and to repent earnestly (3:18–19). The violent image of being vomited out highlights how **intolerable compromised Christianity is to the Lord**. Yet even this severe warning comes with love – *“As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent”* (3:19). **Cross-Reference:** Laodicea’s warning has no exact parallel elsewhere, but the principle is that **God will reject a merely nominal, hypocritical faith** (Matthew 7:21–23). Their self-deception is countered by counsel similar to Isaiah 55:1 (buy true riches without price). Notably, **God “spueing” them out recalls how the land of Canaan would “spue out” its inhabitants for their sin (Leviticus 18:28)** – a vivid way to say God will **cast out the impure**. Christ standing *“at the door”* (Rev 3:20) shows He had been pushed outside by their pride, yet He still knocks, appealing for repentance and restored communion.

## Warnings through the Seven Seal Judgments (Revelation 6–8)

During the breaking of the **seven seals** on the heavenly scroll, a series of divine judgments is unleashed. These serve as escalating **warnings to an unrepentant world**, demonstrating the wrath of the Lamb and urging sinners to repent before worse comes. Each seal judgment carries a message of impending doom for the ungodly:

* **First Seal – Conquest (Rev 6:2):** [Table: First Seal] *“And I saw, and behold **a white horse:** and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and **he went forth conquering, and to conquer**.”* This rider represents **conquest and tyranny**, likely a warlord or antichrist figure who subjugates nations. **Warning:** God allows a deceiving conqueror to triumph as judgment. It warns that humanity’s lust for power and false saviors will lead to oppression. **Context:** This begins the “Four Horsemen” – calamities often associated with the Day of the Lord. **Cross-Reference:** Jesus foretold in the end times “many will come in My name” and of wars (Matthew 24:5–6). The crown and bow indicate a powerful ruler, echoing prophetic images of invading conquerors in Zechariah 1:8–11. The success of this conqueror is a **harbinger** of tribulations to follow.

* **Second Seal – War (Rev 6:4):** [Table: Second Seal] *“And there went out another horse **that was red:** and power was given to him that sat thereon **to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another:** and there was given unto him a great sword.”* This fiery red horse represents **war and bloodshed** spreading over the earth. **Warning:** God’s protection of societal peace is withdrawn – violence and conflict erupt globally as a judgment on human wickedness. It graphically warns that the pride and aggression of mankind will yield slaughter. **Context:** Peace is taken *“from the earth,”* suggesting worldwide turmoil – perhaps civil strife, war among nations, lawlessness and murder. The “great sword” given implies God’s permission for large-scale war. **Cross-Reference:** Jesus predicted *“nation shall rise against nation”* (Matthew 24:7). Ezekiel 21:9–10 speaks of God’s sword sharpened for slaughter – here that metaphorical sword is wielded openly as people slay each other. This judgment echoes God’s oft-repeated warning: *“Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword.”*

* **Third Seal – Famine (Rev 6:5–6):** [Table: Third Seal] *“And I beheld, and lo **a black horse;** and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand… And I heard a voice… say, **A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine**.”* The black horse brings **scarcity and hunger**. A “measure” of wheat for a denarius (a full day’s wage) and three measures of barley for a denarius indicate **extreme inflation and food shortage** – a day’s work barely affords daily bread. **Warning:** Rampant famine and economic collapse will come as judgment. Basic staples become precious while luxury items (“oil and wine”) might be initially spared. It warns that God can strike humanity’s sustenance – an indictment of our self-reliance and injustice (often famine exposes inequality). **Context:** Famine frequently follows war. The command not to harm oil and wine may imply limited scope or God’s mercy in restraining total destruction. **Cross-Reference:** This scenario recalls Leviticus 26:26, where God warns He will break the staff of bread so that **food is weighed out by measure**. Also Ezekiel 4:16–17 describes Jerusalem’s inhabitants eating bread by weight in anxiety – a curse for disobedience. The black horse’s balances signal that **heaven has decreed scarcity** as a wake-up call to repentance.

* **Fourth Seal – Death (Rev 6:8):** [Table: Fourth Seal] *“And I looked, and behold **a pale horse:** and his name that sat on him was **Death, and Hell** followed with him. **And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts** of the earth.”* The ashen-green (pale) horse brings **death on a massive scale**, by multiple means – war (“sword”), famine (“hunger”), pestilence or plague (the word “death” here likely means disease), and wild beast attacks. **Warning:** One-quarter of the earth’s population is killed in this judgment, a sobering declaration that God’s wrath will dramatically cut down the wicked. All forms of calamity combine in a horrifying panorama of death. **Context:** This seal intensifies the previous ones (violence and famine) and adds plague and nature’s hostility. “Hades” (Hell) following means the realm of the dead claims those who perish – implying many die without Christ. **Cross-Reference:** This mirrors God’s “four sore judgments” in Ezekiel 14:21 – **sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence** – which He sends against Jerusalem. It shows Revelation’s judgments align with patterns of God’s past dealings. The scale (¼ of humanity) warns that these are not isolated incidents but **global, divine punishments** – yet still measured, as God in mercy does not destroy all at once.

* **Fifth Seal – Martyrs’ Outcry (Rev 6:10):** [Table: Fifth Seal] *“And they cried with a loud voice, saying, **How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?**”* When the fifth seal is opened, John sees the souls of martyrs under the altar in heaven. Their passionate cry is a **prayer for divine justice**, asking how long until God avenges their shed blood. **Warning:** This seal is unique – it does not inflict a plague but reveals the *imminence of God’s vengeance*. The martyrs’ plea serves as an implicit warning that the **wicked will soon face God’s retribution** for persecuting His people. **Context:** These faithful were slain “for the word of God” and their testimony. They are given white robes and told to rest a little longer until the full number of martyrs is completed (6:11). God’s delay is not denial – it is a **pause of mercy** before final judgment. **Cross-Reference:** The cry “How long, O Lord?” echoes the psalms and prophets (e.g. Psalm 94:3-4, Habakkuk 1:2-4) where the righteous lament oppression. God had promised, *“Vengeance is Mine, I will repay”* (Deuteronomy 32:43, Romans 12:19). This seal assures that the divine warning **will be answered** – the persecutors will drink the cup of wrath they poured out (compare Matthew 23:35–36). It also encourages believers that their suffering is seen by God and not in vain.

* **Sixth Seal – Cosmic Upheaval (Rev 6:16–17):** [Table: Sixth Seal] *“And \[the people of earth] said to the mountains and rocks, **Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:** **For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?**”* When the Lamb opens the sixth seal, a terrifying earthquake occurs; the sun turns black, the moon blood-red, stars fall, the sky recedes, and every mountain and island is moved (6:12–14). All classes of people – kings to slaves – cower in caves, **begging to be crushed by rocks rather than face God’s wrath**. **Warning:** This seal leaves no doubt that the **“great day” of God’s judgment has arrived**. It is a final alarm for anyone still unrepentant: the highest and mightiest cannot endure the Lamb’s fury. The panicked question “Who can stand?” is meant to have the answer: *no one* – except those **redeemed and sealed by God** (as chapter 7 will show). **Context:** The sixth seal spans catastrophic signs in nature and utter terror among Earth’s inhabitants. It dramatically reveals God’s reality to a rebellious world. Jesus in Luke 23:30 foretold people would cry to the mountains “Fall on us” – here it is fulfilled. This is an unmistakable **wake-up call that the end of the age is at hand**. **Cross-Reference:** The imagery draws from Old Testament Day-of-the-Lord prophecies: e.g. Isaiah 2:19 and Hosea 10:8 also describe people hiding in caves, and Joel 2:31 speaks of the sun darkened and moon to blood before the Day of the Lord. It fulfills Jesus’ words in Matthew 24:29. In that Day, only the godly can stand (Malachi 3:2, Psalm 1:5); indeed, Revelation 7 will show God sealing His servants – **implying only by His grace can one “stand” in the judgment**.

* **Seventh Seal – Silence in Heaven (Rev 8:1):** [Table: Seventh Seal] *“And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was **silence in heaven about the space of half an hour**.”* **Meaning:** The opening of the final seal brings a profound **silence in heaven for about 30 minutes**. This hush conveys awe and the weight of what is about to happen. **Warning:** The silence is a dramatic pause – a warning in itself – signaling the climax of God’s plan. All of heaven stands in **reverent, dread silence** before the onslaught of the next judgments (the trumpets). **Context:** Up to now, heaven has been filled with praise and loud cries. Suddenly, at the breaking of the seventh seal, there is complete stillness. This likely indicates the severity of the coming trumpet judgments; it heightens anticipation and gives a last moment of respite. **Cross-Reference:** Silence before judgment reflects Old Testament scenes: *“Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: for the day of the LORD is at hand”* (Zephaniah 1:7), and *“The LORD is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him”* (Habakkuk 2:20). In essence, **“the LORD is about to act – let there be silence!”** (compare Zechariah 2:13). This half hour of silence underscores that *“the LORD hath arisen out of His place”* and the world must stand still and know He is God before the next wave of wrath.

## Warnings through the Seven Trumpet Judgments (Revelation 8–11)

The **seven trumpets** are successive blasts that announce intensified plagues on earth. Each trumpet judgment not only punishes but also **warns survivors to repent** before final doom. As in Egypt’s plagues, these calamities target human pride and false security, urging recognition of God’s power:

* **First Trumpet – Hail and Fire Mixed with Blood (Rev 8:7):** [Table: First Trumpet] *“The first angel sounded, and there followed **hail and fire mingled with blood**, and they were cast upon the earth: and **the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up**.”* **Judgment:** A fiery hailstorm devours vegetation – one-third of the earth’s trees and all the grass are scorched. This trumpet is a **warning through environmental catastrophe**. **Meaning:** God strikes the earth’s ecosystem, demonstrating that creation itself responds to His judgments. It hearkens back to the plague of hail on Egypt (Exodus 9:23-25). **Warning:** Humanity’s food supply and comfort are not guaranteed – God can wither them in an instant. Those who worship nature or rely on the land’s produce are shown the frailty of life. **Cross-Reference:** Ezekiel 38:22 prophesies God will rain fire and hailstones on His foes. Isaiah 2:13 mentions cedars and oaks (lofty things) being brought low in God’s day – here literal forests burn. This first trumpet warns: **if people will not honor the Creator, even basic provisions like green grass can be removed in judgment**.

* **Second Trumpet – Sea Turned to Blood (Rev 8:8):** [Table: Second Trumpet] *“And the second angel sounded, and as it were **a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea:** and **the third part of the sea became blood**;”* (and 8:9 adds that a third of sea creatures died and ships were destroyed). **Judgment:** A massive fiery object (like a blazing mountain) plunges into the ocean, turning one-third of the sea to blood. Marine life is decimated and many ships (commerce) wrecked. **Meaning:** This trumpet mirrors the first Egyptian plague – waters turned to blood (Exodus 7:20-21). It is a **direct assault on the maritime economy and those who depend on the sea**. **Warning:** The permanence of the world’s oceans and the security of global trade are an illusion – God can poison the seas, crippling food sources and commerce. Sailors, merchants, coastal inhabitants are warned that **no earthly stronghold (even the great sea) can protect from God’s wrath**. **Context:** John may be seeing something like a meteor or volcano impact. The imagery of a burning mountain evokes Jeremiah 51:25, where God calls Babylon a “destroying mountain” that He will make a “burnt mountain.” Here, whether symbolic or literal, a great mass hits the sea with disastrous effect. **Cross-Reference:** Psalm 46:2–3 says, *“Though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea… the waters thereof roar,”* a picture of apocalyptic upheaval. This trumpet warns of judgment on idolatries like commerce (cf. later Babylon’s fall in Rev 18). It foreshadows Revelation 16:3 (the later bowl turning *all* sea to blood). In mercy, **only one-third** is affected now – a loud call to repent before total devastation.

* **Third Trumpet – Wormwood Star (Rev 8:10–11):** [Table: Third Trumpet] *“And the third angel sounded, and there fell **a great star from heaven**, burning as it were a lamp… and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; **And the name of the star is called Wormwood:** and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and **many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter**.”* **Judgment:** A flaming star (meteor) crashes onto Earth, contaminating a third of freshwater sources (rivers and springs). The star is named **“Wormwood”** (a bitter poisonous herb). Waters turn bitter and toxic, causing many deaths. **Meaning:** God poisons the drinkable water supply on a massive scale. “Wormwood” in Scripture is associated with bitterness, curses, and sorrow (e.g. Jeremiah 9:15). **Warning:** What is more basic than water? Yet even this can become a deadly toxin at God’s command. Humanity is warned that **life’s essentials are under God’s control** – without repentance, even our wells and rivers can become instruments of death. **Context:** This is a direct reversal of normal expectation – water meant to sustain instead brings death. The specific naming of the star as Wormwood underscores it as a **divinely appointed agent** of bitterness. **Cross-Reference:** Jeremiah 9:15, as cited, says God would feed rebellious Israel with “wormwood water”. Similarly, in Exodus 15:23, Israel encountered bitter waters at Marah until God healed them – here He does the opposite, making waters incurably bitter. The death of “many men” shows the urgency: **these are warning shots that are already lethal**. Those who survive should tremble and turn to God who alone provides the “living water” (John 4:10).

* **Fourth Trumpet – Darkening of Sky (Rev 8:12):** [Table: Fourth Trumpet] *“And the fourth angel sounded, and **the third part of the sun was smitten**, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as **the third part of them was darkened**, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.”* **Judgment:** The celestial lights are dimmed by one-third. This could mean shorter daylight or a partial eclipse-like darkness regularly covering the sky. The world is plunged into gloom. **Meaning:** God strikes the natural order of day and night – a cosmic warning that the dependable rhythm of creation can be disrupted by its Creator. Darkness in Scripture often signals judgment and evil’s hour (cf. the darkness over Egypt in Exodus 10:21-23). **Warning:** This judgment directly confronts humanistic confidence in “Mother Nature” or scientific predictability. The sun itself, which pagans have worshiped through history, is **shown to be under Yahweh’s power**. A dimmed sky warns of approaching *day of the LORD* darkness (Amos 5:18). **Cross-Reference:** Jesus said before His return, *“the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light”* (Mark 13:24). This trumpet echoes that prophecy on a fractional scale – giving people a *foretaste* of the final blackout that will accompany Christ’s coming in wrath. It also harks to the ninth plague of Egypt – thick darkness for three days. In all these, the message is clear: **the God who said “Let there be light” can dim the heavens as judgment on human sin.**

* **“Woe, Woe, Woe” – Threefold Warning (Rev 8:13):** [Table: Threefold Woe] *“And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, **Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth** by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!”* **Meaning:** After the fourth trumpet, an eagle/angel cries out three times “Woe!” to warn that the last three trumpets will be even worse. **“Woe”** is an exclamation of impending doom. **Warning:** This is a *direct call from heaven* to all earth’s inhabitants – the most dreadful judgments are about to fall. It underlines God’s mercy in warning before destroying: as if saying, “You thought the first four were bad? **Repent now, for the next will be far more terrible**!” **Context:** The final three trumpets are sometimes called the “woe-trumpets” (Rev 9:12, 11:14). They shift focus from environmental catastrophe to demonic and spiritual afflictions on mankind. The triple *“woe”* emphasizes how severe and grievous these judgments will be. **Cross-Reference:** Jesus used “Woe” as a lament and warning to unrepentant cities (Matthew 11:21) and hypocrites (Matthew 23). Here, heaven itself pronounces woe on “earth-dwellers” (a term in Revelation for the stubbornly ungodly). This mid-air proclamation highlights God’s desire that people heed the warning: **like a trumpet blast within the trumpets**, it urges any who will listen to seek God’s mercy while they can.

* **Fifth Trumpet – Demonic Locust Plague (Rev 9:6):** [Table: Fifth Trumpet] *(During the fifth trumpet torment) “**In those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it**; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.”* **Judgment:** The fifth trumpet unleashes demonic “locusts” from the Abyss, led by Apollyon, which torment people without God’s seal for five months (Rev 9:1–5, 9:11). The pain is like scorpion stings – agonizing but not killing. Verse 6 vividly states that sufferers will **long to die, but cannot**. **Meaning:** This is a **hellish torture** on unrepentant humanity – a foretaste of the agony of hell where death does not bring relief. **Warning:** When people would prefer death over facing life under God’s judgment, it shows the **extreme severity** of His wrath. Yet even in this, God is merciful – He limits the torment’s duration and forbids the locusts from harming the grass or any believer (9:4-5). The inability to die is a strong warning that **there is no escape from God except through repentance** – suicide, resistance, nothing can release one from His hand during judgment. **Context:** Those without the seal of God (unbelievers) are targeted. The imagery of locusts with scorpion tails is meant to conjure terror; they are instruments of divine wrath that are *psychologically and spiritually tormenting*. **Cross-Reference:** This judgment calls to mind the plague of locusts in Egypt (Exodus 10) but with a horrific twist – these “locusts” attack people, not plants. Joel 2:4–11 describes an army of locust-like creatures as God’s judgment, very similar to Revelation 9, and calls for repentance. The **extreme anguish** yet inability to die also reminds of Job 3:21 (where sufferers long for death in vain). It warns that **hell on earth** can begin even before the grave for those who persist in sin.

* **Sixth Trumpet – Army and Unrepentance (Rev 9:20–21):** [Table: Sixth Trumpet] *“And **the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not** of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols… **Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts**.”* **Judgment:** The sixth trumpet releases four bound angels at the Euphrates and a vast army of perhaps 200 million, who kill **a third of mankind** by plagues of fire, smoke, and sulfur (9:13–18). It’s an unimaginably deadly conflict or plague. But after this slaughter, the survivors still *“repented not”* of their demon-worship and moral crimes. **Meaning:** Even after more than half the world’s population has been wiped out (quarter in the fourth seal, another third now), humanity at large **stubbornly refuses to repent** of idolatry and evil deeds. This highlights the **utter hardness of heart** in “earth-dwellers” and serves as a final indictment against them. **Warning:** The narrative itself warns readers: do not emulate those who persist in sin despite clear judgment. If these horrific plagues don’t bring them to their knees, nothing will. It underscores that when people continually harden their hearts, God’s judgments can further **solidify their rebellion** rather than soften it (just as Pharaoh’s heart hardened in Exodus). **Context:** The sins listed – murders, sorceries (occult practices), sexual immorality, thefts – were rampant. People clung to demon-inspired religion and violence instead of turning to God even when it was obvious He was punishing them. **Cross-Reference:** This mirrors the outcome of the Egyptian plagues: after each plague Pharaoh often relented superficially but ultimately *“hardened his heart”* and would not repent (Exodus 9:34). Similarly, Leviticus 26 and Amos 4 list chastisements where God says *“yet you have not returned to Me.”* The sixth trumpet’s aftermath warns that **continued unrepentance under judgment leads only to greater condemnation**. It highlights the justice of God’s final wrath – for even with dire warning after warning, the wicked refused to change.

* **Seventh Trumpet – Christ’s Reign and Final Wrath (Rev 11:18):** [Table: Seventh Trumpet] *“And the seventh angel sounded… and there were great voices in heaven… saying… (11:18) **And the nations were angry, and Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged**, and that Thou shouldest give reward unto Thy servants… **and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth**.”* **Event:** The seventh trumpet announces the coming of **God’s kingdom in Christ** – *“The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ”* (11:15). It is a triumphant proclamation that Christ shall reign forever. Alongside this, heaven declares that the time has arrived to **judge the dead, reward God’s servants, and destroy the wicked**. **Warning:** The sounding of the last trumpet is essentially a **finish-line warning**: the mystery of God is completed (10:7) – no further delay for repentance remains. It heralds the final judgment scene. For unrepentant sinners, it is a frightful woe (Rev 11:14); for God’s servants, it brings promised reward. **Context:** This trumpet, unlike the prior ones, is more a **pronouncement than a plague**. It likely encompasses the seven bowl judgments (which are the final outpouring of wrath). The language “destroy those who destroy the earth” warns that those who ravaged God’s creation with evil will themselves be **utterly destroyed** by God’s justice. **Cross-Reference:** The seventh trumpet correlates with the “last trumpet” of God in 1 Corinthians 15:52 – at which the resurrection occurs (the time to reward God’s servants). It also parallels Old Testament jubilation at the Day of the Lord: *“The LORD shall be King over all the earth”* (Zechariah 14:9). Yet with the kingdom comes **the final judgment** (Matthew 25:31-32). This trumpet is a warning that the **day of reckoning is at hand** – a point of no return when each person’s fate (reward or punishment) is set. *(Indeed, Revelation 10:7 said when the 7th angel sounds, God’s mystery is finished.)*

## Angelic Proclamations and Other Warnings from Heaven

Throughout Revelation, **angelic messengers and heavenly voices** issue dire warnings and urgent calls to repentance, independent of the numbered seals, trumpets, and bowls. These pronouncements make God’s will explicit:

* **The Flying Angel’s “Three Woes” (Rev 8:13)** [Table: Threefold Woe] – *“Woe, woe, woe to the inhabiters of the earth…”* (as detailed above) was a direct *angelic warning* amplifying the severity of the last three trumpets. It shows God’s desire to *alert* people before the worst strikes. The triple woe essentially shouted: **“Disaster only intensifies – turn to God!”**

* **The Mighty Angel’s Oath (Rev 10:6–7)** [Table: Mighty Angel’s Oath] – A mighty angel, straddling land and sea, swore by God that **“there should be time no longer”**, but in the seventh trumpet the mystery of God would be finished (10:6-7). **Meaning:** No more delay – God’s plan of judgment and redemption was about to be consummated. **Warning:** This solemn oath from a colossal angel is a cosmic announcement that the **final act is beginning**. It warns readers that God’s patience has run out; the period of grace before the end is expiring. After ages of pleading with humanity, **there will come a point when God’s timeline for repentance closes**. (This also was a personal warning to John to prophesy faithfully “again” about the end, 10:11.)

* **“Woe to the Earth and Sea” (Rev 12:12)** [Table: Woe to Earth and Sea] – *“Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! **for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time**.”* This loud cry in heaven comes after Satan is cast down to earth in fury. **Meaning:** It warns that the devil’s thrashing wrath will cause terrible woes on the world, especially targeting God’s people, because Satan knows his remaining time is brief. **Warning:** This is a spiritual warning – human persecution and suffering (the dragon’s rage) will spike in the end-times. Earth’s inhabitants are effectively told, **“Beware! The devil is desperate and dangerous, knowing the end is near.”** It underscores that any “woes” inflicted by the devil are still under God’s sovereignty, for Satan only has “a short time.” **Cross-Reference:** 1 Peter 5:8 similarly warns, *“Your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.”* As the end approaches, that roar intensifies – but Revelation assures us it is because Satan’s defeat is imminent.

* **The First Angel’s Gospel Call (Rev 14:6–7)** [Table: First Angel’s Gospel Call] – *“And I saw another angel fly in midheaven, having **the everlasting gospel** to preach… Saying with a loud voice, **Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters**.”* In an extraordinary move, God sends an angel to globally proclaim the “gospel” – a call to reverence the true God as Creator and Judge. **Meaning:** Even at late hour, God offers good news: **turn and worship the Creator, for His judgment has arrived**. It’s like a final altar call to the world. **Warning:** This angel’s message combines invitation and warning. *“Fear God and give Him glory”* implies **repent of idolatry and pride**, or face the consequences. The reason given – *“because the hour of His judgment is come”* – makes the urgency plain. This heavenly messenger leaves people **no excuse**: the true God’s reality and the demand to worship Him alone are announced openly. **Cross-Reference:** The wording recalls Old Testament worship language (e.g. Psalm 146:6 praises God as maker of heaven, earth, sea). It also echoes Paul’s message to pagans: *“turn from these vanities unto the living God who made heaven and earth and sea”* (Acts 14:15). By referencing the Creator of all sources of life (“fountains of waters”), the angelic gospel underlines that **idols cannot save – only the Creator can, and His judgment is now at hand**.

* **The Second Angel’s Warning of Babylon’s Fall (Rev 14:8)** [Table: Second Angel – Babylon’s Fall] – *“And there followed another angel, saying, **Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city**, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”* This angel announces prophetically the doom of **“Babylon”** – a symbol of the corrupt world system (political, economic, and religious) that seduced mankind into spiritual adultery. **Meaning:** The power centers of evil in the world (**the great harlot city**) are as good as fallen under God’s wrath. **Warning:** This is a heads-up to any still involved in Babylon’s sins: **the proud civilization you trust (with its idolatry, immorality, luxury) will collapse under God’s judgment**. It prepares the way for the explicit command in Rev 18:4 to come out of Babylon. **Context:** In John’s time, this would have hinted at Rome’s eventual fall, but ultimately it points to the end-times global ungodly culture. *“Is fallen, is fallen”* (repeated for emphasis) mirrors Isaiah 21:9’s proclamation of ancient Babylon’s fall. **Cross-Reference:** This anticipates Revelation 17–18 which detail Babylon’s sins and destruction. Jeremiah 51:8 likewise says, *“Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed.”* The angel’s warning assures believers that **no matter how invincible the wicked society looks, God will make it crumble** – so they must not be enticed by it. It also warns the worldly that their “Babylon” will not save them in the day of wrath.

* **The Third Angel’s Warning against Worshiping the Beast (Rev 14:9–11):** [Table: Third Angel – Beast’s Mark] *“And the third angel… said with a loud voice, **If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark…** **the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His indignation;** and he shall be **tormented with fire and brimstone**… **And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night,** who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.”* This is perhaps the **strongest personal warning in Scripture** about eternal damnation. **Meaning:** An angel plainly warns that **anyone who gives allegiance to the beast (Antichrist) – symbolized by taking his mark and worshiping his image – will suffer the full wrath of God eternally**. God’s wrath “without mixture” means undiluted, not tempered by mercy. The imagery of **fire, brimstone, rising smoke, and endless torment** makes clear this refers to **hell (the second death in the lake of fire)**. **Warning:** This is a final notice: **Do not take the mark! Do not side with Antichrist!** Choosing the beast over God is choosing unending wrath. Unlike other judgments that were partial (one-third, etc.), this is **absolute** – *full cup* of wrath. There will be **no rest, no relief, forever** for those who commit this ultimate apostasy. **Cross-Reference:** This warning fulfills the concept of God’s “cup of wrath” given to the wicked (Psalm 75:8, Jeremiah 25:15). It also aligns with Jesus’ words about hell: *“where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched”* (Mark 9:48). The phrase *“smoke of their torment ascends forever”* echoes Isaiah 34:10’s description of Edom’s perpetual burning. This terrifying prospect is given in advance by an angel so that **no one who hears can say they were not warned** of the eternal consequences of worshiping the beast. It starkly divides humanity: better to suffer persecution from the beast than to suffer the inextinguishable wrath of God.

* **Blessed Warning to Watch (Rev 16:15):** [Table: Blessed Warning to Watch] In the midst of the sixth bowl (as demonic spirits gather armies to Armageddon), **Jesus Himself interjects**: *“Behold, **I come as a thief**. **Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments**, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.”* **Meaning:** Christ issues a sudden exhortation to believers: **stay awake and clothed in righteousness, because I will come like a thief – suddenly and unexpectedly**. **Warning:** Though a blessing for the watchful, it is a warning that anyone not spiritually alert and “clothed” (in Christ’s righteousness and purity) will be caught exposed in shame at His coming. In practical terms, **no compromise or slacking off**, even as the world convulses – Jesus can arrive at any moment. **Context:** This is stated as the world’s armies assemble for the final battle – at humanity’s darkest hour, Jesus reminds His own to stay ready for His intervention. It’s a gracious insert, showing that even in wrath God’s heart is for His people to endure and not be found unprepared. **Cross-Reference:** The thief imagery again recalls Christ’s teachings (Luke 12:39-40, 1 Thess. 5:2). *“Keeping garments”* alludes to remaining clothed with Christ (Galatians 3:27) and good works (Revelation 19:8). It may also nod to the Temple guard practice: a guard caught sleeping might have his clothes stripped and burned – here Christ urges us not to be caught spiritually sleeping. The *blessing* (“blessed is he that watches”) matches Jesus’ beatitude in Luke 12:37 – *“Blessed are those servants whom the Lord, when He comes, shall find watching.”* Thus even in the throes of Revelation’s judgments, Christ lovingly warns His disciples to **be vigilant, pure, and expectant for His sudden return**.

* **“Come Out of Babylon” (Rev 18:4–5):** [Table: Come Out of Babylon] *“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, **Come out of her, my people**, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. **For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities**.”* **Meaning:** God directly calls His people still in “Babylon” (the corrupt world system or city) to **separate themselves – to flee from its sins – so that they will not be caught in Babylon’s impending judgment**. **Warning:** Any compromise or entanglement with the immoral, idolatrous culture of “Babylon” will prove fatal when God’s plagues fall on it. This is a merciful final warning to believers (or those who will hear) to **break off worldly alliances and lifestyles** that God has condemned. **Context:** Revelation 18 describes the fall of the symbolic great city “Babylon the Great,” judged in one hour for her arrogance and corrupting influence. Before destroying it, God calls out any of His own from within – just as angels warned Lot to leave Sodom (Genesis 19:15–17). **Cross-Reference:** Similar commands were given in the Old Testament: *“Flee out of the midst of Babylon”* (Jeremiah 51:6, 45) and *“Depart, depart, go out from there, touch no unclean thing”* (Isaiah 52:11). In the New Testament, 2 Corinthians 6:17 echoes, *“Come out from among them and be separate… and touch not the unclean thing.”* Thus, Revelation’s call is the climactic form of a longstanding biblical warning against **compromise with the sinful world**. It assures that Babylon’s sins are piled to heaven – judgment is certain – so God’s people must dissociate or **share in Babylon’s plagues**. The urgency and clarity leave no middle ground: one must choose holiness over the harlot city’s seductions.

* **Invitation to the Birds – Doom of Earth’s Armies (Rev 19:17–18):** [Table: Invitation to the Birds] *“And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in midheaven, **Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and… of mighty men… of all men, both free and bond, both small and great**.”* **Meaning:** Just before Christ strikes the gathered armies of the beast at Armageddon, an angel calls carrion birds to **gather for a grisly feast** on the corpses of God’s slain enemies. **Warning:** This graphic announcement is a symbolic **declaration of doom** on the wicked forces arrayed against God. It warns that no matter their rank or strength (kings, captains, mighty men), they will become carrion. In essence, *“Prepare to die and be devoured”*. **Context:** This occurs at Christ’s Second Coming (Rev 19:11–21). It stands in stark contrast to the “Marriage Supper of the Lamb” for the righteous (19:9). The *“supper of the great God”* is the aftermath of battle – a scene of total defeat for the beast, false prophet, and their followers. **Cross-Reference:** This fulfills Ezekiel 39:17–20, where God invites the birds and beasts to feast on the fallen armies of Gog: *“Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty… and drink the blood of the princes.”*. Both passages serve as **taunting warnings** to God’s foes – their end is utter humiliation. By issuing this call *before* the battle is even joined, the angelic herald underscores the certainty of Christ’s victory. For readers, it’s a warning not to align with “the kings of the earth” against God, for they are **destined for slaughter**. It’s also a grim encouragement to believers that all the oppressors and persecutors (the “mighty men”) will be food for vultures – God **will** avenge His people.

## Warnings through the Seven Bowl Judgments (Revelation 16)

The **seven bowl (vial) judgments** are the final, unrestrained outpouring of God’s wrath. They complete the warnings of the trumpets, this time with *“the wrath of God… filled up”* (15:1). The bowls are **plagues without mercy** – yet they still demonstrate God’s justice and serve as cautionary signs to those experiencing them. By the time of the bowls, most opportunity for repentance has passed (as seen by repeated notes that people blaspheme God and refuse to repent). Nonetheless, each bowl underscores specific warnings:

* **First Bowl – Painful Sores (Rev 16:2):** [Table: First Bowl] *“And the first \[angel] went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; **and there fell a noisome and grievous sore** upon the men which had the **mark of the beast**, and upon them which worshipped his image.”* **Judgment:** Ugly, festering sores break out on all who carry the beast’s mark and worship his image. **Warning:** This plague targets beast-worshipers specifically, showing that **devotion to the Antichrist cannot protect – rather it brings a curse from God**. It’s reminiscent of the boils on the Egyptians (Exodus 9:10). The warning is twofold: *to the wicked:* your allegiance to evil yields misery; *to any wavering:* do not take the mark (reinforcing the earlier angelic warning)! **Cross-Reference:** Deuteronomy 28:27 warned Israel that disobedience could bring *“boils of Egypt”* and *“tumors”* – incurable plagues on the skin. Here the idolaters receive just that, fulfilling the justice that those who persecuted God’s people (and likely imposed the mark) now **themselves writhe in incurable pain**. It vindicates God’s earlier warning in Rev 14:11 that the marked would have “no rest day or night.”

* **Second Bowl – Sea Becomes Blood (Rev 16:3):** [Table: Second Bowl] *“And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; **and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea**.”* **Judgment:** The entire sea (not just a third, as with the second trumpet) coagulates like putrid blood, killing *every* sea creature. The scope is global and total for oceanic life. **Warning:** This bowl shows **utter devastation** – the world’s oceans, which seemed vast and inexhaustible, can be slain in a moment. It’s a rebuke to those who trust in nature or the stability of creation. Moreover, the sea turning to blood is an undeniable sign that **these are divine plagues paralleling Moses’ day** – a last warning that “this is the finger of God” (Exodus 8:19). But unlike earlier, here it’s not partial; it’s final. **Cross-Reference:** In Exodus 7:17–21, the Nile turned to blood, killing fish and making water undrinkable. Now the plague is universal. Isaiah 50:2 says, *“I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink because there is no water, and die of thirst.”* Such prophecies come to full term here. The warning in this bowl is implicit: **if even the sea (symbol of commerce, travel, life’s origin) is destroyed, what hope remains for the unrepentant?** None – except to recognize the Judge.

* **Third Bowl – Rivers and Springs to Blood (Rev 16:4–6):** [Table: Third Bowl] *“And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; **and they became blood**. …And I heard the angel of the waters say, **Thou art righteous, O Lord… because Thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and Thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy**.”* **Judgment:** All fresh water sources are turned to blood. An angel praises God’s justice in this, noting it repays the persecutors in kind – they shed the blood of saints, now they must drink blood. **Warning:** This plague not only punishes but sends a clear message: **divine retribution**. It warns persecutors and murderers of the righteous that *“according to your deeds it will be done to you”*. The world that delighted in the blood of martyrs now literally has blood to drink. **Context:** By this point, likely many of the remaining unbelievers participated in or consented to the beast’s slaughter of God’s people. This bowl leaves no doubt why judgment is falling. **Cross-Reference:** Jesus said, *“with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you”* (Matthew 7:2). Revelation 18:6 likewise says of Babylon, *“Reward her even as she rewarded you, double unto her double according to her works.”* Here is that principle executed: **blood for blood** (compare Genesis 9:6). The angel’s declaration “they are worthy” is chilling – a warning that *all* God’s judgments are true and fair. No one undergoing these plagues can claim innocence. The takeaway: **shedding innocent blood is utterly abhorrent to God – and in the end He will repay it in kind**.

* **Fourth Bowl – Scorching Heat (Rev 16:8–9):** [Table: Fourth Bowl] *“And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and **power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.** And men were scorched with great heat, and **blasphemed the name of God**, which hath power over these plagues: **and they repented not to give Him glory**.”* **Judgment:** The sun’s heat intensifies unbearably, searing people with fire. Instead of repenting, people curse God. **Warning:** This plague hits the *opposite* of the fourth trumpet – now the sun’s power is not diminished but amplified to torture level. It warns that what is normally a blessing (sunlight and warmth) can become a curse at God’s command. The fact that people still **“repented not”** is a solemn warning about hard-heartedness – showing that without a change of heart, **even the most blistering judgment won’t produce repentance**. It implicitly warns readers: *do not harden your heart; these people’s refusal to repent led only to further blasphemy and doom.* **Cross-Reference:** Deuteronomy 28:22 warned disobedient Israel of *“burning heat”*. Malachi 4:1 prophesied, *“the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud… shall be stubble.”* Here is that oven-like day. Ironically, earlier in Revelation 7:16, God promised that in glory, *“neither shall the sun light on \[the saints], nor any heat.”* The righteous are spared, but the wicked are **scorched**, yet instead of crying for mercy they curse God – exactly fulfilling Wisdom 16:16 from the apocrypha: *“the ungodly that denied to know Thee were scorched by the heat of the sun.”* The warning couldn’t be clearer: **stubborn refusal to glorify God under judgment only confirms one’s damnation**.

* **Fifth Bowl – Darkness and Pain (Rev 16:10–11):** [Table: Fifth Bowl] *“And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon **the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness;** and they gnawed their tongues for pain, **and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds**.”* **Judgment:** The beast’s entire kingdom (the world of the ungodly) is plunged into a tangible darkness, accompanied by agonizing pain (perhaps the cumulative effect of sores + heat + now darkness). People bite their tongues in torment. They still blaspheme God and do not repent. **Warning:** This bowl is targeted – it strikes at the very throne of Antichrist, proving he is powerless to stop the true God. It also eerily foreshadows the fate of the lost: **pain and darkness** (cf. Matthew 8:12, “outer darkness” with weeping and gnashing of teeth). The warning is that those who chose the beast’s false light now inherit literal darkness. **Cross-Reference:** The ninth plague of Egypt was a three-day darkness that could be felt (Exodus 10:21-23). Here it’s global and perhaps longer. Joel 2:2 and Amos 5:18 describe the Day of the Lord as *“darkness, not light.”* Jesus in the fifth trumpet had warned *“be watchful, don’t be caught naked”*; those who ignored Him now find themselves **in darkness and utter misery**, yet they still curse rather than repent. The repetition – “they blasphemed… and repented not” – is a dire refrain. **It warns that by this stage, the character of the wicked is fixed** (just as Revelation 22:11 later states). Persisting in evil through so many warnings leads to a point of no return where repentance is no longer found. Thus, **today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts** (Hebrews 3:15).

* **Sixth Bowl – Euphrates Dried & Kings Deceived (Rev 16:12–14):** [Table: Sixth Bowl] *“And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon **the great river Euphrates;** and **the water thereof was dried up,** that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. And I saw… **three unclean spirits like frogs**… the spirits of devils, working miracles, **which go forth unto the kings of the earth… to gather them to the battle** of that great day of God Almighty.”* **Judgment:** The Euphrates River (a major barrier) is dried, allowing eastern kings to march west. Demonic spirits perform signs to lure the world’s rulers to assemble for one final war against God at Armageddon (16:16). **Meaning:** God sovereignly *draws* the nations to the place of their doom – even using demonic deception to accomplish His plan. Drying Euphrates recalls how Cyrus diverted that river to conquer Babylon; here God removes obstacles so the last enemies can gather. **Warning:** This bowl is more preparatory, but its warning is implicit: **all the political-military might of the world is being maneuvered into a deadly trap**. The very miracles that convince the kings to mobilize are demonic. It warns that **satanic deception can gather the whole world to fight God – a literally Armageddon-level folly**. Only those with spiritual discernment (believers) won’t be fooled. This sets the stage for the ultimate “fight” in which the Lamb utterly triumphs (Rev 19). **Cross-Reference:** In 2 Thessalonians 2:9–12, Paul says the lawless one will come with satanic signs and lies, and that **God will send a strong delusion on those who refused the truth, so they believe the lie** – to their condemnation. The sixth bowl fulfills this: God permits the frogs (lying spirits) to lure the obstinate nations into one place to receive the *coup de grâce*. The warning is that **human pride and demonic influence together drive the nations to literally make war against their Creator** – the ultimate act of insanity and rebellion, which can only end in complete destruction.

* **Seventh Bowl – “It is Done!” (Rev 16:17, 16:20–21):** [Table: Seventh Bowl] *“And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, **It is done**… And **there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake**, such as was not since men were upon the earth… **And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell**… And **great hail**… every stone about the weight of a talent, fell upon men: and **men blasphemed God** because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.”* **Judgment:** The final bowl triggers the most powerful earthquake in history, splitting cities, toppling nations, even rearranging geography (islands and mountains vanish, 16:20). Gigantic hailstones (about 75–100 pounds each) bombard the earth. God’s voice declares, “It is done,” meaning His wrath is completed. Astoundingly, survivors **still blaspheme God** instead of begging for mercy. **Meaning:** This is **the grand finale of judgment** – the utter collapse of human infrastructure and society. “Babylon the great” (the wicked world system) is specifically mentioned as being judged (16:19). **Warning:** “It is done” signals **the end – no more delay, no more opportunity**. The greatest earthquake and the massive hail underscore that **nothing can stand before the fury of God’s wrath**. All proud works – skyscrapers, cities, monuments – crumble in an instant. The continued blasphemy of men even now is a warning that some hearts can become irredeemably hardened. They fulfill what was said of those who gnawed their tongues yet blasphemed (16:10-11). **Cross-Reference:** The imagery draws on final judgment prophecies: Ezekiel 38:19-22 speaks of a great earthquake and torrential hail in the end battle, and Isaiah 30:30 mentions the Lord’s voice with hailstones and lightning. Joshua 10:11 records God using large hail to destroy Israel’s enemies – here He does so on a global scale. The seventh bowl warning is final: **the Kingdom of this world has fallen; the Kingdom of God is replacing it** (anticipating the refrain “It is done” echoed in Revelation 21:6 when God makes all things new). For the wicked, it warns of irreversible doom – they are literally crushed under the weight of judgment they can no longer escape. For the reader, the takeaway is to **flee to Christ now**, for when these things come, **the time for repentance will have fully run out**.

## Ultimate Judgments and Final Warnings (Revelation 19–22)

At the climax of Revelation, we see the **final execution of God’s judgments** – the Second Coming of Christ, the overthrow of all evil powers, the Last Judgment of the dead, and the reality of eternal punishment. Alongside these, Revelation concludes with **sober warnings and exhortations** for all who hear the book’s prophecy:

* **The Beast & False Prophet Cast Alive into Fire (Rev 19:20):** [Table: Beast & False Prophet] After Jesus returns as King of Kings (19:11-16) and annihilates the gathered armies, *“the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet… **These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone**.”* **Meaning/Judgment:** The Antichrist (beast) and his chief deceiver are **personally thrown into the lake of fire** – eternal hell – without even passing through physical death. **Warning:** No matter how powerful or persuasive evil leaders are, they will be **utterly doomed** before Christ. This is a warning especially to those who followed the beast: their supposed savior is consigned to everlasting burning in a moment. If the leaders meet such an end, what of their followers? (In fact, Revelation 19:21 notes the rest were slain by the sword from Christ’s mouth.) **Cross-Reference:** Daniel 7:11 foresaw the beast slain and *“his body destroyed and given to the burning flame.”* Here it comes to pass. Isaiah 14:9-10 taunts the king of Babylon in Sheol, and similarly one could imagine the shock of the beast’s followers as he is abruptly removed. The lake of fire appears here for the first time – it is the place of ultimate punishment prepared for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41). The warning inherent is that **alignment with Satan’s man leads to sharing Satan’s fate** (as Rev 14:11 had warned).

* **Satan’s Final Doom (Rev 20:10):** [Table: Satan’s Doom] After the Millennium, Satan mounts one last rebellion (20:7-9), which is swiftly crushed by fire from heaven. \*“And **the devil** that deceived them **was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and **shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever***.”* **Judgment:** The devil – the ancient serpent, source of all the woe – is finally hurled into the same lake of fire, to be **endlessly tormented**. **Warning:** The chief adversary meets his fate; it is a warning that **all evil, even its supernatural instigator, will not escape God’s judgment**. For humans, it’s implied warning too: if that is Satan’s destiny, think twice about whom you serve. The eternal duration (“forever and ever”) is emphasized – **no annihilation, no reprieve** for the devil or anyone there. **Cross-Reference:** Isaiah 14:15 foretold of Lucifer, *“Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.”* Jesus also said of the devil’s eternal fire (Matthew 25:41). Now Revelation confirms it in no uncertain terms. This stands as both promise (to God’s people that evil will be punished) and warning (to every soul: do not join the devil’s losing cause).

* **Great White Throne – Judgment of the Dead (Rev 20:11–12, 15):** [Table: Great White Throne] *“And I saw a **great white throne**, and Him that sat on it… **And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened**… and **the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works**… **And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire**.”* **Judgment:** This is the final judgment of **all the unsaved dead** (“the rest of the dead,” 20:5). They are resurrected to stand before God’s throne. The record books of their deeds are opened, as well as the Book of Life. All whose names are not in the Book of Life are thrown into the lake of fire (which is the “second death,” 20:14). **Warning:** This is the ultimate courtroom scene – **no one escapes this appearance**. Every station of life (“small and great”) must give account. Being judged “according to works” is fearful, because **all have sinned** – and indeed, any whose sins are not forgiven through Christ are doomed. The explicit warning: **if your name is not in the Lamb’s Book of Life, the lake of fire will be your eternal lot**. There is no other outcome. The time for mercy is past at this point; it’s pure justice. **Cross-Reference:** Many scriptures foretell this judgment. Jesus described how all nations will be gathered and separated (Matthew 25:31-46). Daniel saw thrones and *“the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened”* (Daniel 7:10), exactly as here. Paul told of *“the day when God will judge the secrets of men”* (Romans 2:5,16). The Book of Life is mentioned throughout Scripture as containing the names of God’s true people (Philippians 4:3, Luke 10:20). The **terrifying warning** is that **anyone relying on their own works will be condemned by those very works**, since the books will reveal every sin. Only those **washed in the blood of the Lamb** have their names in the life-book (Revelation 7:14, 13:8). Thus Revelation warns: *“Blessed are they that do His commandments (wash their robes), that they may have right to the tree of life”* (Rev 22:14) – everyone else will be outside, in the second death.

* **The Second Death – Lake of Fire for All Wicked (Rev 21:8):** [Table: Second Death] In contrast to the blessings of the New Jerusalem, it is declared: \*“But \**the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, **and all liars**, **shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death**.”* **Judgment:** This is a comprehensive list of those whose lives were characterized by sin and unbelief – their “portion” or inheritance is the fiery lake. **Warning:** [Table: Second Death] Any person persisting in these sins, refusing God’s grace, will join this fate. The list includes cowardice (“fearful” – those who shrink from confessing Christ under pressure), lack of faith, vile deeds, sexual immorality, occult practices, idolatry, and habitual dishonesty. In short, **all whose lives prove they rejected God will undergo the second death**. This is a solemn warning that **heaven will be holy – none of these sinful lifestyles will enter** (as similarly stated in Rev 21:27 and 22:15). **Cross-Reference:** Similar vice lists are given in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and Galatians 5:19-21, each concluding that *“those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.”* Revelation 21:8 is final confirmation. It forever dispels any notion that one can “have Christ” but also cling to sin – true faith results in overcoming (Rev 21:7), whereas the persistent

* **Solemn Warning about Altering God’s Word (Rev 22:18–19):** [Table: Altering God's Word] *“For I **testify** unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book: **If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book**. And **if any man shall take away from the words** of the book of this prophecy, **God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city**, and from the things which are written in this book.”* **Meaning:** As Revelation (and thus the whole Bible) closes, John, by the Spirit, gives a direct warning: **tampering with God’s revealed word is a salvation issue**. **Warning:** [Table: Altering God's Word] To **add** one’s own false doctrines or “new revelations” alongside Scripture is to invite all the curses and plagues described herein. To **subtract** – by distorting, denying, or suppressing any part of God’s message – is to forfeit one’s share in eternal life. This is a terrifying deterrent against false teaching, “editing” God’s message, or handling Scripture irreverently. It asserts the sufficiency and finality of Revelation’s prophecy (and by extension the Bible). **The stakes could not be higher**: twist God’s Word, and you will suffer **all the plagues** of Revelation (which include all the horrors we’ve catalogued – essentially a foretaste of hell on earth), and ultimately lose all blessings (no access to the tree of life or Holy City). **Context:** In John’s immediate context, this guarded the integrity of the Revelation prophecy as it was copied and circulated. In the broader canon, it echoes Moses’ warning not to add or remove from God’s law (Deuteronomy 4:2) and similar wisdom in Proverbs 30:5-6. **Cross-Reference:** Those earlier verses (Deut. 4:2, Prov. 30:6) show God has always jealously guarded His Word. This final warning **preserves Revelation as the capstone of Scripture**, under penalty of damnation for alteration. Church history confirms the danger: heretics who have “added” strange teachings or “removed” uncomfortable truths have led many to destruction – and these verses indicate they will face the full wrath of God. For the believer, it is a call to **handle the Word with utmost fear and faithfulness**, not shaping it to our liking. It’s fitting that the last warning in the Bible concerns the Bible itself – for how one responds to God’s Word is how one responds to God. As Jesus said, *“He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him – the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day”* (John 12:48).

In summary, the Book of Revelation presents **uncompromising warnings** from the risen Christ and His angels: **calls to repent, threats of judgment, and vivid previews of wrath**. From the letters to churches (“repent, or else…”) to the cataclysms of seals, trumpets, and bowls, to the ultimate damnation of the unrepentant, God’s message is consistent: *He is holy, He will punish sin, and He desires people to turn to Him before it’s too late.* These warnings are given in a “no-nonsense” tone, reflecting God’s militancy against evil and falsehood – there is no room for compromise with the world or with sin. **Blessed are those who heed these warnings**: *“Behold, I come quickly; blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book”* (Rev 22:7). Conversely, the book ends with the sober refrain that Jesus is coming and His recompense with Him (22:12), and with an invitation: *“And let him that is athirst come”* (22:17). The warnings of Revelation, therefore, serve to shake the complacent, encourage the faithful, and drive all hearers to find refuge in the grace of the Lord Jesus – before the coming **“great day of His wrath”**, when indeed **no one will be able to stand**.
