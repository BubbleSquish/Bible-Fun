# Super Spin Model (SSM) – Concepts and Potential Analogies in Cancer Research

## Overview of Meyer’s Super Spin Model (SSM)

The *Super Spin Model (SSM)* is a cosmological framework introduced by A. J. Meyer II in 1995 as a unifying theory that interconnects gravity with quantum parameters. In his paper **“The Unification or Interconnection of the Gravitational Constant G to the Electron Charge e…”**, Meyer proposes a nonstationary, axially symmetric space-time (essentially an evolving Kerr-like black hole or spinning cosmic string) as the initial state of the universe. The SSM attempts to link fundamental constants – the gravitational constant *G*, the elementary charge *e*, Planck’s constant *h*, the speed of light *c*, and particle masses – within a single model. By doing so, it aims to unify all four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear forces) conceptually.

At its core, SSM envisions the universe beginning as an extremely dense, **maximally spinning “cosmic string”** of Planck-scale density. This primordial object can be thought of as a *toroidal Kerr black hole* or “spinning geon,” which arose from a quantum vacuum fluctuation. The initial quantum fluctuation is posited to have an enormous energy (on the order of the Planck mass \~10^(-5) grams) that somehow “gets stuck” in this rotating topological defect, acting as a **one-way valve** that prevents the energy from simply annihilating back into the vacuum. In other words, the creation event of the universe in SSM is inherently *time-asymmetric* – it produces a new structure that cannot fully revert to the prior vacuum state, thereby setting an “arrow of time” from the very start. This feature is key to SSM’s explanations for various asymmetries observed in physics.

Meyer’s model claims to resolve several long-standing puzzles. For example, it offers qualitative or quantitative answers to why the observed universe contains much more matter than antimatter (no primordial antimatter domains), why certain microscopic processes violate time-reversal and parity (mirror) symmetry, why protons do not decay readily, why the photon-to-baryon ratio is about 10^9, why the electron and proton rest masses have the values they do, and **why entropy grows with time (the arrow of time)**. The SSM provides formulas for specific physical phenomena as well – e.g. it derives the neutron’s vacuum beta-decay lifetime (\~15 minutes) from first principles of the model and computes cosmological parameters (universe age, density, background radiation temperature, etc.) that align with empirical estimates. In essence, SSM is an ambitious speculative cosmology that combines general relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

Before exploring analogies to cancer, we outline a few key theoretical constructs of the SSM that will later be juxtaposed with biological concepts:

* **Geons and Primatons:** The building blocks of the model, essentially gravitational-electromagnetic entities at extreme density (including the Planck-mass “primaton” photon).
* **Dual Event Horizons & Entropy Redefinition:** An extended Kerr black hole thermodynamics that counts both inner and outer horizon areas toward entropy, ensuring consistency with the Third Law of thermodynamics.
* **Dual Space-Time Metric and Time Asymmetry:** The SSM metric is time-direction-dependent (“dual”), breaking time-reversal symmetry and even mirror symmetry, which leads to **particle rest-mass rescaling** (differentiating matter vs antimatter over time).
* **Rescaling of Particle Masses:** In SSM the rest masses of particles vs. their antiparticles (or past- vs future-traveling states) diverge over cosmic time, even as total energy is conserved, providing a mechanism for matter’s dominance.

Each of these exotic ideas in SSM can be tentatively reinterpreted in a metaphoric or modeling sense when thinking about cancer biology. Below, we first explain these SSM concepts in more detail, then discuss how analogous principles – entropy, time asymmetry, space-time curvature, quantum field notions, etc. – appear in or could be applied to cancer research.

## Key Theoretical Constructs of the SSM

### Geons and Primatons – Planck-Scale “Building Blocks”

Meyer draws on John Wheeler’s 1950s idea of the *geon* (“gravitational electromagnetic entity”) – essentially a bundle of light held together by its own gravity, sometimes called a *Kugelblitz* or “ball of light”. A geon is a kind of microscopic black hole solution of general relativity where electromagnetic field energy creates a tiny trapped region of space-time. In the extreme case of a geon consisting of a single photon of Planck-scale energy, the object is called a **“primaton”** in Meyer’s work. A primaton photon has a rest mass on the order of the Planck mass (m\_p ≈ 2.18×10^(-5) g) and a correspondingly minute wavelength (\~10^(-33) cm). Meyer notes that an isolated primaton photon is *isomorphic* (equivalent in energy and angular momentum attributes) to a maximally spinning Kerr black hole of Planck energy. In other words, the primaton is like the smallest possible black hole (or a quantum of a “spinning string”), with an **enormous energy density** \~5.87×10^111 erg/cm³ – effectively the maximum energy density allowed classically.

More generally, *primatons* in SSM are defined as particles that satisfy an **extreme Kerr-Newman condition** relating their spin, charge, and mass in a specific way. Various fundamental particles could be considered primatons of different types: e.g. a “primaton electron,” “primaton neutrino,” etc., each corresponding to an extreme-state solution with certain spin (*n\_s*) and charge (*n\_e*) quantum numbers. This essentially embeds standard particles into the SSM framework by assigning them idealized extreme properties (for instance, a “primaton electron” would be a spin-1/2, unit charge primaton, etc. ). While these constructs are highly speculative, they serve to link familiar quantum particles with black-hole-like properties in the model.

**Significance:** In SSM, primatons are the *primordial quanta* of the universe’s mass-energy content. The entire universe itself is envisioned as a coherent assembly (a *“circle of primaton light”*) that initially took the form of a closed circular string of N primaton photons. This spinning loop of light corresponds to a massive toroidal geon, which then “inflated” to cosmic dimensions at creation. The primaton concept thus blurs the line between particle and black hole, suggesting that at the extreme Planck scale they become one and the same. This idea underpins how SSM can treat the early universe (and possibly all particles) within a unified geometric and thermodynamic description.

### Entropy Redefinition with Dual Event Horizons

Black hole thermodynamics traditionally assigns an entropy **S = (kc^3/ħG) \* (A/4)** proportional to the area *A* of the event horizon (Bekenstein-Hawking formula). For a Kerr black hole (rotating black hole), however, space-time contains **two distinct event horizons**: an outer horizon and an inner (Cauchy) horizon, due to rotation creating an ergosphere. Meyer’s SSM explicitly takes into account *both* horizon surfaces. He defines the entropy in an “expanded Kerr topology” as including contributions from **both inner and outer event horizon areas**, rather than just the outer horizon. By doing so, the model achieves consistency with the Third Law of Thermodynamics. (The Third Law essentially says entropy approaches a constant minimum as temperature approaches zero. In black hole terms, an extremal black hole with T→0 should have a well-behaved entropy; considering only the outer horizon can lead to issues as an extremal Kerr or Reissner–Nordström black hole still has a finite horizon area, whereas incorporating the second horizon can resolve such inconsistencies.)

In SSM’s thermodynamics, one works with a **“disjoint event horizon area”** concept – effectively treating the two horizons’ areas together. Meyer shows that if you only considered one horizon in a Kerr black hole, certain generalized laws (like a generalized Second Law or Third Law) would *not* hold. But when both horizons are included, a generalized entropy can be defined that does obey the usual thermodynamic requirements over the full range of parameters. The paper’s figures and equations (e.g. Fig. 1 in the paper) illustrate how temperature (T\_+ and T\_- for outer and inner horizon) and entropy (S\_+ and S\_-) relate, summing to an overall entropy S that remains positive and increases irreversibly. In fact, Meyer describes an inner-horizon-associated “negentropy” S\_- (negative entropy) and an outer-horizon entropy S\_+, whose **sum** S(φ) is the total entropy at a given stage. This clever redefinition ensures that as the black hole evolves, the total entropy S(φ) increases monotonically (satisfying the Second Law), even though one of the horizon areas might shrink, because the other grows in compensation. By the time the SSM universe has expanded to the point that the inner and outer horizons coincide (in a “Schwarzschild limit” as rotation slows), the total entropy is extremely large and aligned with what we observe as the entropy of the universe.

**Significance:** This dual-horizon entropy concept is an SSM hallmark. It effectively doubles the degrees of freedom considered in black hole entropy accounting, thereby preserving thermodynamic laws in a cosmological setting. Importantly, it embeds *time asymmetry* into the fabric of space-time: the growth of entropy is tied to the *evolution* of the black hole/universe. In the SSM scenario, the **increase of entropy with time is no accident but a built-in feature** – the model explicitly *accounts* for why “entropy increases with time” in our universe. By treating the black hole (or initial cosmic string) as a thermodynamic system with evolving horizons, Meyer can describe an arrow of time at the cosmic scale.

### Dual Space-Time Metric and Time Asymmetry

One of the most distinctive (and speculative) aspects of Meyer’s SSM is that space-time is treated as having a **dual, time-oriented metric**. In a normal physical theory, the laws are usually time-symmetric (except for subtle violations in particle physics); a positron can be viewed mathematically as an electron moving backward in time, for instance, with identical mass. SSM, by contrast, *builds in an asymmetry*: the metric of the universe is different for future-directed processes versus past-directed processes. In practical terms, this means SSM’s equations yield *two solutions at any given moment* – one corresponding to matter moving forward in time, and one to the “CP-conjugate” (Charge/Parity conjugate) matter which can be thought of as antimatter moving backward in time (or vice versa). These two solutions are **not identical**; the metric gives them different properties, a direct violation of time-reversal symmetry (T) and inversion symmetry (P). Meyer states explicitly that the SSM metric is *“nonstationary, dual, time asymmetric, and non-symmetric under spatial inversion”*. This means the universe’s geometry *knows* an arrow of time and a left/right distinction, which is a radical departure from classical General Relativity or standard cosmology.

A major consequence of the dual metric is that **geodesics (the “straight-line” paths in curved spacetime) for past-directed vs. future-directed particles gradually diverge from each other** as the universe evolves. Right at the moment of pair creation (e.g. when a particle and antiparticle are produced), they might start off with the same mass-energy. But as time goes on, the particle following the future-directed geodesic experiences a slightly different curvature than its antiparticle cousin on a past-directed geodesic. The SSM universe is not static or flat; it has a curvature that *increases* the difference between those two paths over time. In effect, the space-time has **“dual curvatures everywhere”** – one associated with the forward-time direction and one with the backward-time direction. These dual curvatures lead to two coincident but non-identical metrics embedded in the same universe, yielding two sets of values for what would naively be the same quantity.

### Particle Rest Mass Rescaling (Matter–Antimatter Divergence)

Given the dual, time-oriented nature of the SSM metric, one startling prediction emerges: *the rest masses of particles can change over time, and differently for matter vs. antimatter*. Meyer refers to this as *rest mass rescaling*. Earlier ideas by Dirac, Hoyle, and others had speculated that perhaps fundamental constants or masses might vary slowly over cosmological time, or that gravity *G* might change. Meyer’s twist is that in SSM the **total mass-energy of the universe is conserved and constant**, but *individual* particle rest masses are “rescaled covariantly and contravariantly” depending on their temporal orientation (future or past), charge, and parity. In plainer terms, all particles created as a matter–antimatter pair start with identical mass m₀, but as the universe ages, a matter particle’s rest mass might scale as *m<sub>+*</sub> = m₀\[1 + f(t)] while its antimatter partner scales as *m<sub>−*</sub> = m₀\[1 + g(t)]\*, with f(t) ≠ g(t). The difference is extremely small in today’s epoch (we don’t observe proton mass drifting, for instance), but integrated over billions of years since creation, SSM suggests a significant divergence occurred.

Crucially, the rescaling is set up such that **energy conservation still holds globally** – if one particle’s rest energy increases, the other’s effectively decreases, balancing out. Meyer shows that at the moment of creation, matter and antimatter have equal rest mass (by symmetry). But because matter follows the “future-directed metric” and antimatter the “past-directed metric,” their geodesic paths are not identical in the curved SSM space-time. As a result, as time proceeds, the two rest mass values **“slowly diverge, resulting in two different time-varying rest mass levels for all past-directed and future-directed particles”** that were originally twins. This tiny bias accumulates, so that in the present universe, the stable matter particles (protons, electrons, etc.) have slightly different masses than their antiparticle counterparts would have. SSM uses this to explain the matter–antimatter asymmetry: essentially, once particles and antiparticles separate after the Big Bang, the antimatter might undergo processes (like decaying or annihilating more readily) due to its altered effective mass or energy, leaving normal matter dominant. Meyer notes that **baryon number conservation becomes a local, time-dependent phenomenon** in such a universe; there is no global requirement that equal amounts of matter and antimatter persist. Thus, *“the conundrum about why there appears to be more matter than antimatter is answered”* by SSM’s built-in CPT asymmetry.

To summarize, in SSM:

* The **total mass-energy M** of the universe is fixed and does not change with time.
* However, every stable particle species sees its rest mass *m* evolve slowly as a function of the cosmic time and the particle’s identity (matter or antimatter, etc.).
* This is permitted because the metric itself is time-dependent (nonstationary) and *not* time-symmetric. The metric effectively “lends” energy to one set of particles while “taking” from the other, in a manner consistent with field equations.
* All conservation laws hold at creation (pair production yields equal m for particle and antiparticle), but thereafter a symmetry is broken. SSM yields an analytic expression for how masses rescale; for example, one finds formulas like *m<sub>+(t)</sub> = m₀\[1 + sin(Φ(t))]* and *m<sub>−(t)</sub> = m₀\[1 + sin(Φ(–t))]* (schematically). Here Φ is a time parameter related to the evolving horizon angle in the Kerr-like geometry. This implies at *t = 0*, sinΦ = 0 and m₊ = m₋ = m₀, but for t>0, sinΦ(t) ≠ sinΦ(–t), so m₊ ≠ m₋.

**Significance:** Particle rest-mass rescaling is the mechanism by which SSM *breaks the symmetry* between matter and antimatter (and also time-reversal symmetry) while remaining consistent with overall energy conservation and known physics (no exotic new forces, just general relativity in a complex topology). It effectively introduces a *cosmic evolution of intrinsic properties*, something outside standard physics. This idea – that environment or time can alter a fundamental property like rest mass – is far-reaching. In conventional science, rest mass of elementary particles is fixed (aside from high-energy corrections or Higgs mechanism effects which are not time-dependent). SSM suggests a novel viewpoint that the “constants” might not be constant when viewed in a cosmological, time-imbalanced context.

Having detailed the SSM’s main concepts, we now turn to the **question of analogy**: can any of these physical principles or mathematical structures be *reinterpreted or repurposed* to aid our understanding of cancer? This means venturing into interdisciplinary speculation, looking for parallels between cosmological models (like SSM or black hole physics generally) and biological phenomena (like tumor development and behavior). Below, we consider each concept – entropy and time’s arrow, dual domains and space-time curvature, quantum field analogies, rest-mass rescaling – in the context of cancer, and review any historical or emerging efforts to link such disparate fields.

## Entropy, Time Asymmetry, and Irreversibility in Cancer

**Entropy increase and the arrow of time** are central to both SSM and the biology of cancer. In SSM, the entropy of the universe unavoidably rises as the dual event horizons expand – providing a built-in explanation for the thermodynamic arrow of time. Similarly, living systems (and especially cancerous growths) are subject to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. A growing tumor is an open thermodynamic system that consumes energy and nutrients and produces waste and disorder. In fact, **cancer progression is often characterized by increasing disorder at molecular and cellular levels**, essentially an entropy-driven process. The concept of entropy has been repeatedly invoked in oncology and systems biology to describe the loss of regulated order in cells as they become malignant. For example, randomness in gene expression profiles, accumulation of mutations (genomic instability), and chaotic signaling networks in cancer cells have all been described in terms of increased “information entropy” or “entropy of signaling” in the literature. In a healthy multicellular organism, cells exist in a low-entropy, highly ordered state (cooperating and regulated), whereas a cancerous cell population breaks away into a higher-entropy state of disordered growth and evolution.

Quantitatively, researchers have even tried to measure the **entropy generation rate** of cancer cells versus normal cells. Cancer cells, due to their rapid proliferation and dysregulated metabolism, produce more entropy (i.e. they generate more heat, waste, and randomness) than normal healthy cells. One recent thermodynamic analysis notes: *“It has been proved that cancer cells have a higher entropy generation than healthy cells. The entropy generation rate shows the intensity of proliferation, invasion, and robustness in cancer cells. Therefore, entropy dynamic modeling… can be an efficient tool in cancer research.”*. In other words, measuring how fast entropy is produced (via heat, for instance) can indicate how aggressive or advanced a tumor is. This aligns well with the intuitive notion that a fast-growing tumor is a highly irreversible process – it drives the system away from equilibrium much quicker than normal tissue does.

Because cancer development is fundamentally **time-asymmetric** (it progresses in one direction – a cell population becomes increasingly malignant and does not spontaneously revert to normal without external intervention), the *arrow of time* is a pertinent consideration. One might say that cancer is a manifestation of the arrow of time in biology: it’s a break from the organism’s homeostasis that tends towards disorder unless energy (therapy) is applied to push it back. In fact, proposals exist to leverage entropy and time-asymmetry for treatment: for example, *Luo (2009)* suggested using methods like induced pH changes, electromagnetic fields, or ultrasound to *reverse the entropy flow* in cancer cells as a therapy. The idea is that by reducing entropy (increasing order or inducing some form of organization) one might force cancer cells back towards a non-cancerous state or make them more prone to die. While highly experimental, this shows the crossover of thermodynamic concepts into the cancer domain.

**Analogy to SSM:** In SSM, the universe’s creation is a one-way event that generates entropy and cannot be undone. This is analogous to the initiation of a tumor: once a critical set of mutations or conditions is reached in a cell (sometimes termed a “cancer-initiating event”), a cascade is set off that is effectively irreversible – the system has found a new attractor state (cancer) and won’t return to the old state (healthy tissue) without external work. The SSM’s **“one-way valve”** at the birth of the universe, which prevents the return of energy to the vacuum, is conceptually similar to the way a cell crossing into malignancy reaches a point-of-no-return. In both cases, an *entropy barrier* is crossed: the universe’s entropy jumps and cannot go back down, and a cell’s entropy (considering genetic chaos, etc.) increases to the point that normal regulatory processes cannot restore order.

Additionally, Meyer’s inclusion of **dual entropy (S\_+ + S\_–)** to satisfy the Third Law can inspire thinking about a cancerous system in terms of *internal vs. external entropy*. A tumor exists in a host organism; one could consider the “entropy” within the tumor microenvironment and the entropy in the rest of the body. If one only looked at the tumor in isolation, one might miss how the host compensates (or fails to compensate) for the tumor’s entropy production. Analogous to Meyer’s approach of including inner and outer horizon areas, a **comprehensive thermodynamic accounting in cancer** might need to consider both the tumor and its environment together. For instance, as tumor cells proliferate (increasing internal entropy), the organism might respond with fever, inflammation, or metabolic changes (increasing systemic entropy). Ensuring that the **combined entropy of tumor + host** obeys expected principles (and understanding how energy flows between them) could be important, just as including both horizons was necessary to obey thermodynamic laws in SSM. This analogy remains speculative, but it suggests a systems view: treat the tumor and body as a single system with an entropy budget, akin to a black hole and its surroundings.

## Space-Time Curvature and Dual Domains: Tumor Microenvironment as a “Warped” Space

Gravity in general relativity is geometry – mass-energy curves space and time. In SSM, the early universe’s extreme mass density means space-time is highly curved (essentially forming a closed spinning geometry). How could **space-time curvature or dual space-time** relate to cancer? Of course, *literal* curvature of physical space by a tumor’s mass is negligible (even a large tumor’s gravity is astronomically small). But as an analogy, we can think of **curvature in a more general sense of a field that influences trajectories**.

In a tumor microenvironment, the “fields” that dictate trajectories are things like nutrient concentration gradients, oxygen levels, mechanical stress fields, and signaling molecule distributions. A growing tumor creates steep gradients – for example, cancer cells in the interior consume oxygen rapidly, creating a hypoxic (low-oxygen) core, while cells at the periphery have more oxygen. This is a **heterogeneous landscape**, and cell movement or drug diffusion through it is analogous to moving through a curved space (paths bend toward nutrient sources, etc.). One could say the tumor *warps the “fabric” of its microenvironment* – not in the gravitational sense, but in the sense of altering flows of fluids, diffusion of chemicals, and even the architecture of tissue (extracellular matrix is remodeled by tumor enzymes, creating tortuous paths). The result is that anything moving in the vicinity of a tumor (cells, molecules) no longer travels in straight lines in a uniform medium; it follows convoluted paths shaped by the tumor’s presence. This bears conceptual similarity to particles following curved geodesics around a gravitating mass.

Furthermore, one might consider the **tumor and host as two connected domains** (akin to two space-time regions separated by an interface). In SSM’s dual space-time picture, we have effectively two simultaneous space-time solutions (for past- and future-oriented matter) occupying the same universe. By analogy, in cancer we have the tumor region and the normal tissue region co-existing but with very different “parameters” (pH, oxygen, signaling dynamics). There is a boundary – sometimes sharp – between malignant and healthy tissue, much like an event horizon is a boundary between two regions of space-time with different properties. Some cancer researchers even use terms like *“niche”* for the immediate tumor surrounding, versus the far-field environment. We can draw a parallel: **inside the tumor vs. outside the tumor** is not unlike **inside a black hole vs. outside a black hole** in the sense that information flow and conditions are drastically different across the boundary. For example, a signal molecule released inside a tumor might get broken down or trapped before it ever escapes to the outside tissue (analogous to how information or light from inside an event horizon cannot reach an outside observer). On the other hand, certain “signals” do escape a tumor – e.g. cancer cells shed exosomes (nano-sized vesicles) that travel through the bloodstream to distant sites, preparing them for metastasis. These escaping influences are reminiscent of Hawking radiation or jets from a black hole, carrying information from the otherwise isolated core to the external world.

This is not merely a fanciful comparison – some scientists have explicitly drawn analogies between **tumor behavior and black hole behavior**. In a 2021 article, Santoni *et al.* describe conceptual similarities between a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at a galaxy’s center and a tumor in a body. They point out that both systems exhibit **“feeding” and “feedback” cycles across multiple scales**. An SMBH feeds by accreting matter (gas, stars) from its galaxy, and it provides feedback via powerful jets and winds that can heat or expel gas, affecting star formation in the galaxy. Analogously, a tumor “feeds” by tapping into the host’s nutrient supply and energy – for instance, inducing angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels) to draw in blood, and consuming glucose at high rates. In turn, the tumor produces feedback signals: it releases growth factors, inflammatory signals, and **exosomes** that can alter the behavior of surrounding normal cells and even distant organs (preparing metastatic niches). Santoni et al. structured these analogies on three scales:

* **Micro-scale:** within the tumor (intratumor communication, e.g. cells exchanging signals via exosomes).
* **Meso-scale:** tumor interacting with immediate environment (e.g. tumor cells vs. immune cells in the microenvironment).
* **Macro-scale:** tumor influencing distant parts of the body (e.g. via circulating exosomes establishing pre-metastatic niches in other organs).

These were deliberately mapped to the astrophysical scales of an SMBH accretion system (accretion disk microphysics, galaxy-scale inflows, and intergalactic feedback). The authors even suggest that **mathematical models used for black hole feeding–feedback could be repurposed to model tumor growth and metastasis**. For instance, differential equations or simulations that handle inflow/outflow of matter in accretion disks might be analogous to modeling how nutrients flow into a tumor and cells disseminate out. While this is a fresh and still speculative approach, it underlines the utility of the **black hole as a metaphor for a tumor** – both are centralized “masses” that drastically alter their surroundings and have far-reaching effects.

SSM goes a step further with its *dual space-time* idea by essentially having two overlapping universes (past-directed and future-directed) interacting. We could stretch this analogy to cancer by considering that a tumor often ends up with regions of very different character (e.g. a hypoxic, necrotic core vs. a proliferating rim). These two regions are like dual phases of tumor existence – one part is “dying” (past-oriented, in a sense) and one is expanding (future-oriented). They coexist and influence each other (cells in the dying core release metabolites that may stimulate growth at the rim, etc.). Though biological, this isn’t too far from thinking of **coincident domains with differing time orientations**: the core might be consuming itself (some tumors have cells cannibalize neighbors or undergo cell death – a bit like an entropy sink), while the rim is vigorously growing (entropy source). In a conceptual way, this resembles two subspaces within the tumor: one trending backward (degenerating) and one trending forward (expanding). The **interface** between them could be seen as analogous to an internal boundary layer, like an inner horizon. If one were to model the tumor’s growth thermodynamics rigorously, one might need to account for both regions (just as Meyer accounted for inner and outer horizons to fully capture entropy dynamics).

Finally, we can consider **mechanics**: Tumors create physical forces – they exert pressure on surrounding tissue as they expand (often leading to pain or organ dysfunction). This mechanical distortion is akin to how a mass curves space – except it’s deforming elastic tissue. Researchers talk about the *stiffness* of tumors; interestingly, tumors are often stiffer than normal tissue, and this difference can “curve” the paths of migrating cells (e.g. immune cells might detour around a stiff tumor region, analogous to light bending around gravity wells). In this sense, the **curvature analogy** becomes quite literal in the context of *mechanotransduction*: cells sense and respond to curvature or stiffness gradients in their environment. It is not general relativity, but it is a geometric influence on trajectories all the same.

## Quantum Field Analogies: Fields, Information, and “Rescaling” in Cancer

SSM and other cosmological theories often invoke quantum field theory (QFT) – fields filling space, particles as excitations of fields, vacuum fluctuations, etc. How might **quantum field analogies** apply to cancer? One straightforward way is to note that cells in a tissue can be viewed through the lens of field theory: we can define fields for nutrient concentration, fields for signaling molecules, even a field for cell density. Modern theoretical biology sometimes uses *reaction-diffusion equations* (a staple of field theory in continuous media) to model how tumor cells and chemicals interact in space and time. For example, **Turing patterns** (from reaction-diffusion systems) have been used to model heterogeneous patterns in tumors. These are classical field analogies.

There have also been more direct attempts to bring quantum concepts into disease modeling. For instance, a paper by J. I. Jacobson (2016) proposed a *“quantum theory of disease”* in which various quantum phenomena (like the Quantum Hall effect, cyclotron resonance, etc.) are considered as part of the functioning and dysfunction of biological systems. Jacobson’s work even introduces a new particle-wave equation for biological interactions and speaks of “dual resonance” and “quantum transpositional states” to restore order in diseased cells. While this approach is on the fringe and not widely accepted, it demonstrates the desire to find deeper physical analogies for complex diseases like cancer. The author specifically highlights concepts of **entropy in selective magnetic domains** and the possibility of using very weak electromagnetic fields to induce order (reduce entropy) in tissues. This can be seen as drawing inspiration from quantum field theory – treating cellular assemblies as quantum-like ensembles that might be steered by external fields.

Another example is the use of the **Free Energy Principle** (from theoretical neuroscience, originally) in understanding biological systems. This principle, championed by Karl Friston, posits that organisms self-organize to minimize their *free energy* (in an information-theoretic sense, related to surprise or prediction error). Intriguingly, a recent analogy by Tiger C. Joo (2021) combined black hole thermodynamics with Friston’s Free Energy Principle to compare black holes and cancerous tumors. Joo describes black holes as *“cosmic free radicals”* – regions of extreme energetic and informational disequilibrium, much like tumors are in a body. Both black holes and tumors **concentrate energy and information** and seem to violently increase entropy locally. The analogy suggests that just as black holes irreversibly suck in matter/energy (increasing entropy and hiding information behind horizons), cancer cells voraciously consume resources and upset the informational order (for example, tissue architecture and signaling networks). Both systems can be thought of as trying to reach a new equilibrium: a black hole by maximizing its entropy (absorbing everything until no gradient remains), and a tumor by growing until resource limitations or interventions halt it. Joo’s interdisciplinary interpretation implies that *universal principles of energy and information transformation* might underlie both cosmic phenomena and cancer. In particular, if one views a tumor through the Free Energy Principle lens, the tumor is “trying” to minimize free energy – it’s just that in doing so, it destroys the host’s normal order (similar to how a black hole’s drive to grow comes at the expense of its surroundings).

**Particle “rest mass” rescaling** in SSM also invites analogy. In SSM, as discussed, matter and antimatter effectively end up with different rest masses over time due to the dual metric. While cells don’t have a notion of “rest mass” in the same sense, they do have a concept of *fitness* or *growth rate* that determines their fate in an evolutionary sense. One could say that, initially, normal cells and a rogue (potentially cancerous) cell start off on equal footing (analogous to equal m₀ at pair production). But as time goes on in an evolving environment, the “rogue” cell’s properties rescale – e.g., it acquires mutations that allow it to grow faster (effective fitness increases) or to avoid death signals (effective death rate decreases). Meanwhile, the surrounding normal cells’ relative fitness might decrease in that local environment (they might be crowded out or starved by the tumor). This mirrors the idea of one set of particles gaining an upper hand (matter) while the other loses out (antimatter) in SSM. Both situations are essentially **symmetry breakings leading to dominance of one side**. In SSM it’s matter dominating antimatter; in cancer, it’s malignant cells dominating over normal cells in a tissue.

One could even draw a parallel between **CPT symmetry in physics and homeostatic symmetry in biology**. A healthy tissue maintains a balance between cell birth and death (analogous to matter–antimatter balance). Cancer breaks this symmetry – cell birth greatly exceeds cell death. In SSM, CPT symmetry (charge, parity, time) is broken such that matter creation is not balanced by equal matter destruction (antimatter). In cancer, pro-growth signals overpower anti-growth signals, and the system tilts towards runaway expansion. The mathematical structure of SSM’s rest-mass rescaling (with one term going up, another down, summing to constant) is reminiscent of a zero-sum game. Similarly, in an ecosystem of cells, if one population’s expansion comes at the cost of another’s decline, the total cell count might obey some conservation at large, but the distribution shifts. In *eco-evolutionary models* of tumors, one sometimes sees equations where the total carrying capacity is fixed, but cancer cells replace normal cells – effectively *N\_cancer + N\_normal = const*. This is analogous to *m<sub>+*</sub> + m<sub>−*</sub> = const* in SSM.

Another possible link is the idea of **rescaling time or rates**. SSM introduces a time-varying metric that changes particle properties as the universe ages. In cancer biology, the passage of time often accelerates changes – tumors can become more aggressive (higher grade) as they progress, meaning the effective “constants” governing cell behavior (like mutation rate, metabolic rate) might change with the stage of cancer. Researchers sometimes speak of tumors “evolving” faster over time due to increased genetic instability – one could say the internal evolutionary clock of the tumor is speeding up (a sort of time-rescaling). While not a deliberate analogy to cosmic time rescaling, it is interesting that **time itself (and its asymmetry)** plays a huge role in cancer: earlier intervention is crucial because given more time, the tumor’s entropy and disorder only increase, and its internal parameters may shift to more malignant values.

## Interdisciplinary Bridges: Cosmology and Cancer

Historically, physics and biology have intersected in areas like radiology (using physics to kill cancer cells) and biophysics, but direct analogies between *cosmology* and *cancer* are relatively new and speculative. A notable early contribution was by Erwin Schrödinger in 1944 (“What is Life?”) where he introduced the idea of **negative entropy (negentropy)** as something organisms feed on to maintain order. This concept loosely connects thermodynamics and life, and by extension, applies to cancer as well – a tumor could be seen as feeding on the host’s negentropy to grow. However, Schrödinger didn’t talk about black holes or cosmology per se.

In recent years, with the advent of complex systems science, we see more creativity in drawing parallels across scales. We already discussed Santoni et al. (2021) who explicitly crafted a *multi-scale analogy* between black hole phenomena and tumor microenvironments. They even suggest that such analogies *“allow the crossover of mathematical models between these two fields”*, hinting that equations used in astrophysical simulations (like fluid dynamics equations for accretion, or feedback loop models) might inspire new models for tumor growth and metastasis. This is a concrete interdisciplinary effort, backed by authors from both oncology and astrophysics, demonstrating the potential fruitfulness of the approach.

Another intriguing idea from cosmology is **cosmological natural selection** (proposed by Lee Smolin), which analogizes universe reproduction in black holes to biological evolution. While not directly about cancer, it’s an example of using *biological metaphors* for cosmological phenomena. Conversely, using cosmological metaphors for biological phenomena is less common, but we’ve seen a few: e.g., the *“Big Bang”* as a metaphor for the origin of a cancer (a single catastrophic mutation that spawns a “universe” of mutant cells), or referring to metastases as “colonizing new worlds”. Even the term **“universe”** is sometimes used in cell biology (the “tumor universe” meaning the entire ecosystem of a tumor).

There have been philosophical forays as well. Some authors, like Tiger Joo, invoke black hole **thermodynamics** (entropy, temperature of black holes) in the context of cellular processes. Black hole thermodynamics has peculiar laws – for instance, the area of a black hole’s horizon *never decreases*, paralleling the Second Law of entropy. One could metaphorically liken a tumor’s volume (or some measure of its disorder) to a black hole’s horizon area: once a tumor has grown (and disorder increased), it rarely spontaneously shrinks without treatment (mirroring that one needs to inject energy or matter outflow to reduce a horizon area, as in Hawking radiation which in biology would be akin to therapy-induced shrinkage).

On the *information* side, black holes famously pose the information paradox – information that falls in seems lost, yet quantum theory suggests it cannot be destroyed. In cancer, there is an analogue: a cell’s original regulatory information is seemingly lost as it turns cancerous (the normal regulatory “program” is no longer accessible), but in principle the information is still encoded in the system (perhaps in mutation patterns or in epigenetic changes). Some researchers have asked if one can *decode* the “history” of a tumor by reading its mutations – akin to retrieving information that fell into a black hole by analyzing Hawking radiation. This analogy is quite speculative, but it shows how deep concepts might translate: **the past history (cause) of a cancer is encrypted in its genome** like a message in Hawking radiation, since cancer cells carry the marks of the processes (mutations, selection) that made them. Indeed, tumor genome sequencing is used to infer evolutionary history of the cancer.

Finally, the notion of **dissipative structures** in thermodynamics provides a broad bridge between cosmology and life. As an example, Egan and Lineweaver (2008) argue that all dissipative structures in the universe (from stars and hurricanes to living organisms) arise because the universe began in a low-entropy state and has free energy to dispense. In their view, life (and by extension cancer, which is life gone awry) is a phenomenon that *accelerates entropy production*, helping the universe reach equilibrium faster. A tumor is an extremely effective entropy generator (as discussed, it produces lots of entropy via rapid cell divisions and metabolic waste) – so one might poetically say *the tumor is the universe’s way of increasing entropy* in that locale, consistent with the second law’s universal drive. This does not *medically* justify cancer, of course, but it frames it in a cosmological context: cancer could be seen as a natural consequence of thermodynamic imperatives, just manifesting at the biological level.

In summary, while cosmological theories like Meyer’s SSM were never intended to describe something as local and biochemical as cancer, the exercise of finding parallels is intellectually stimulating. **Entropy and time asymmetry** provide perhaps the strongest bridge – both cosmic evolution and cancer progression are arrow-of-time, entropy-increasing processes. The idea of **dual domains or horizons** suggests viewing tumors as separate “worlds” with their own rules, separated from normal tissue by informational and chemical boundaries (much as an event horizon separates regions of spacetime). **Space-time curvature** finds a metaphor in the way tumors deform and influence their environment, drawing analogies to how mass curves space and affects trajectories. **Quantum field analogies** encourage us to use field-based models for tumor dynamics and even borrow principles like free-energy minimization or resonance effects to understand or treat cancer. And the exotic notion of **rest-mass rescaling** in SSM is mirrored by how cancer “breaks symmetry” in tissue, causing one population (malignant cells) to effectively change its fundamental parameters and overtake the system.

It must be emphasized that these are *analogies* – a tumor is not literally a black hole (for one thing, energy can escape a tumor in the form of heat, whereas nothing escapes a classical black hole). However, analogical thinking can lead to new hypotheses. For instance, Santoni et al. propose that understanding how feedback loops stabilize or destabilize black hole accretion could inspire ways to disrupt feedback loops in a tumor (like the vicious cycle of inflammation or angiogenesis). Likewise, considering a tumor as a thermodynamic system might encourage treatments that target its entropy production (e.g. cutting off its energy supply to starve it, akin to depriving a black hole of infalling matter). The cross-pollination of cosmology and oncology is a bold frontier – one that treats cancer not just as a genetic or cellular phenomenon, but as a process that can be described with the same fundamental principles that govern stars and galaxies. As our discussion shows, **entropy, time’s arrow, and feedback dynamics** are common threads linking the fate of the universe with the fate of a cancer patient, and exploring these links can yield fresh insights in both science and medicine.
