## Watch and Pray Always (Avoid Temptation)

🔹 ***Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.***
The Savior commands His disciples to be constantly vigilant in prayer and watchfulness.  If they fail to do so, they risk being overcome by the devil’s temptations.  This is a direct warning that spiritual vigilance is necessary to avoid falling into sin (the devil “sifts” believers like wheat).

🔹 ***Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.***
Here Jesus reiterates the same counsel to the multitude.  He emphasizes that Satan *desires* to lead the faithful into temptation, so they must “watch and pray always.”  The warning underscores that without constant prayer and humility, even the disciples could fall prey to Satan’s schemes.

*Context:* These warnings are spoken by Jesus Christ to the Nephite disciples (and the assembled multitude) during His visit to the Americas and the institution of the sacrament.  He has just given them ordinances and then cautions them to uphold these commands faithfully.  The people being warned are Christ’s followers—especially the twelve disciples—and all the Nephites gathered on the temple grounds.

## Built on Rock vs. Sandy Foundation (Obedience)

🔹 ***But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell are ready open to receive them.***
Christ warns that anyone who adds to or takes away from His commandments (symbolized by the precise ordinances of the sacrament and prayer He has taught) is not built on His “rock” (the true Gospel) but on sand.  Such a person’s spiritual foundation will not withstand trials; when troubles come, they will fall and be taken captive (“hell” here symbolizes spiritual ruin).

*Context:* Jesus gives this warning immediately after teaching the sacrament prayers (bread and wine) in 3 Nephi 18.  He is speaking to His disciples and all who have accepted His church, commanding them to do exactly as He taught.  The warning applies to those who might corrupt or neglect His commandments.  It parallels Christ’s parable in Matthew 7:24–27, emphasizing that obedience to His teachings is the rock-solid foundation.

## Breaking Command Leads to Temptation

🔹 ***And ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not; … and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.***
Jesus instructs the disciples not to exclude anyone from partaking of the sacrament ordinance.  He warns that if they break *this* command (forbidding people from coming to Christ), they will be led into temptation themselves.  In other words, failing to include everyone (especially repentant believers) in His ordinances is itself a sin that leads one into error and temptation.

*Context:* These words come as Jesus wraps up His instructions on the sacrament with His disciples.  He has told them to administer the ordinance to all who repent and have faith.  The warning is directed to the ordained disciples (and by extension all church leaders): if they reject even one person trying to come unto Christ, they break Christ’s command and thus fall into temptation.

## Woe to Unrepentant People

🔹 ***Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice…***
In a voice heard over the land, Jesus Himself pronounces three-fold “wo” (great woe) on the people.  He is condemning the current generation for its sins and calling all on earth to repent.  The declaration “wo unto… except they shall repent” is a dire warning: if the people do not turn from their wickedness, they will face destruction.

*Context:* This warning comes at the beginning of 3 Nephi 9, immediately after the catastrophic natural disasters that destroyed many Nephites.  It is the *voice of Christ* (during a supernatural darkness) proclaiming judgment to *everyone who hears it*.  The recipients are “this people” (the Nephites of Zarahemla and surrounding lands) and, as He says, “the inhabitants of the whole earth,” since the effect is across the continent.  It underscores that without repentance, all are in the devil’s power (he rejoices at their downfall).

## Woe to Unrepentant Gentiles

🔹 ***Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses… I will destroy thy chariots.***
Here Jesus warns that the Gentile nations (European-descended peoples) will receive judgment if they do not repent of their sins.  He foretells that God the Father will “cut off” elements of their military power (horses, chariots) as punishment.  The phrase “wo unto the Gentiles except they repent” signals the imminent destruction that will fall on them as fathers in Israel if they remain wicked.

*Context:* This prophecy is spoken by Jesus to the Nephites (as recorded in 3 Nephi 21) about future events.  Though He quotes the Father’s words (“saith the Father”), Jesus Himself is delivering the warning.  The “Gentiles” refer to later nations (eventually including the United States) who first received the Book of Mormon.  The warning is part of Christ’s discourse on the last days and the destiny of Israel and the Gentiles.

## Cut Off from the Covenant for Unbelief

🔹 ***…at that day whosoever will not repent and come unto my Beloved Son, them will I cut off from among my people, O house of Israel;***
Jesus (speaking as the Father) declares that those of Israel who refuse to repent and accept Christ will be cut off from the covenant people.  To be “cut off” means to be removed from the blessings and presence of the Lord.  This is a solemn warning that unrepentant unbelief leads to exclusion from God’s covenant community.

*Context:* This statement is part of Christ’s prophecy to the Nephites regarding the gathering of Israel in the latter days.  The immediate audience is the remnant of Israel (Nephites and Lamanites), but it extends to all of “house of Israel” (the tribes of Israel in the last days).  Christ emphasizes that coming unto Him (through repentance and baptism) is necessary, or else one is severed from God’s people.

## Accursed Who Deny or Contend Against Truth

🔹 ***And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him be accursed; and he that shall deny these things, let him be accursed; … saith Jesus Christ, for I am he who speaketh.***
Jesus (revealed to Moroni) pronounces a curse on anyone who debates against or denies the revealed word (in this case, the Jaredite record preserved for our day).  To “be accursed” means to be under divine condemnation with no hope of receiving further revelation.  It is a stern warning: those who reject or fight against God’s word will have no part in His purposes.

*Context:* These words come in Ether 4, where Moroni is commanded to seal (hide) the Jaredite writings until a later time.  Here Jesus speaks through Moroni to future readers.  The warning is for all who encounter the Book of Mormon: if they “contend” with its teachings or deny its truth, they will be accursed and will not receive additional light from God.

## Destruction by Fire at Christ’s Command

🔹 ***And at my command the heavens are opened and are shut; and at my word the earth shall shake; and at my command the inhabitants thereof shall pass away, even so as by fire.***
Jesus warns that He has power over the elements and life itself.  At His command He can open or close the heavens, cause the earth to shake, and send fire to destroy all people.  The warning is that, on the last day or in judgment, He can consume the earth by fire at His word.

*Context:* This follows the previous curse in Ether 4.  Moroni records Jesus’ words to convey the power of Christ’s judgment.  It serves as a general warning of the Lord’s ability to execute final destruction (as He did in past judgments) if His adversaries persist.  The immediate context is still the Jaredite record, but the broader meaning is the coming day of the Lord when He will consume the wicked with fire.
